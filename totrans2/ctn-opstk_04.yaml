- en: The Linux kernel has supported containers for several years. Microsoft also
    recently started to support containers in the form of Windows Server containers
    and Hyper-V containers. As containers have evolved over time, so has OpenStack
    support for containers. OpenStack provides APIs to manage containers and their
    orchestration engines within the data centers.

- en: OpenStack is used by a large number of organizations. Cloud infrastructure vendors
    have called OpenStack an open source alternative to Amazon Web Services for organizations
    aiming to maintain a private cloud but with public cloud scalability and agility.
    OpenStack is popular for Linux-based **Infrastructure as a Service** (**IaaS**)
    offerings. As containers are gaining popularity, it's become necessary for OpenStack
    to provide various infrastructure resources such as computing, networking, and
    storage to containers. Rather than creating new vertical silos to manage containers
    in their data centers, developers and operators can find value in providing a
    cross plate-form API to manage virtual machines, containers, and bare metals.

    tool regardless of which containers, virtual machines, or bare metal servers are
    being used. Containers complement existing technology and bring a new set of benefits.
    OpenStack provides the support to run containers on bare metal or virtual machines.
