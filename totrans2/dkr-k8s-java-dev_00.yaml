- en: Imagine creating and testing Java EE applications on Apache Tomcat or Wildfly
    in minutes, along with deploying and managing Java applications swiftly. Sounds
    too good to be true? You have a reason to cheer, because such scenarios are possible
    by leveraging Docker and Kubernetes.

- en: This book will start by introducing Docker and delve deep into its networking
    and persistent storage concepts. You will be then introduced to the concept of
    microservices and learn how to deploy and run Java microservices as Docker containers.
    Moving on, the book will focus on Kubernetes and its features. You will start
    by running the local cluster using Minikube. The next step will be to deploy your
    Java service in the real cloud, on Kubernetes running on top of Amazon AWS. At
    the end of the book, you will get hands-on experience of some more advanced topics
    to further extend your knowledge of Docker and Kubernetes.
