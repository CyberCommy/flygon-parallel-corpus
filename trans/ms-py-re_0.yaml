- en: 'Text processing has been one of the most relevant topics since computer science
    took its very first baby steps. After a few decades of investigation, we now have
    one of the most versatile and pervasive tools that exist: regular expressions.
    Validation, search, extraction, and replacement of text are operations that have
    been simplified thanks to Regular Expressions.'

- en: This book will initially cover regular expressions from a bird's-eye view, proceeding
    step-by-step to more advanced topics such as regular expression specifics on Python
    or grouping, workaround, and performance. All the topics will be covered with
    Python-specific examples that can be used straightaway in the Python console.
