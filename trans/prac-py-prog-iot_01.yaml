    before exploring and playing with a variety of networking techniques using Python
    to build network- and internet-connected services and applications. We will also
    create simple web user interfaces that work with the techniques and examples we
    will learn about.

    in, learn about and play with electronics, and start building and tinkering. I
    know I would be! So, [Chapter 2](9436dfb5-3c70-4aff-9f64-512b7843b0cb.xhtml), *Getting
    Started with Python and IoT* is dedicated to building a simple internet-connected
    IoT project from the ground up – electronics and all – so that we have a reference
    example for later chapters (and something to tinker with!).
