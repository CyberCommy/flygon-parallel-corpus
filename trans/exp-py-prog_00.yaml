- en: People used to see Python as yet another scripting language and wouldn't feel
    right about using it to build large systems. However, over the years and thanks
    to some pioneer companies, it became obvious that Python could be used to build
    almost any kind of system.

    and make it their language of choice.

- en: '[Chapter 1](ch01.html "Chapter 1. Current Status of Python"), *Current Status
    of Python*, showcases the current state of the Python language and its community.
    It shows how Python is constantly changing, why it is changing, and also why these
    facts are important for anyone who wants to call themselves a Python professional.
    This chapter also features the most popular and canonical ways of working in Python—popular
    productivity tools and conventions that are de facto standards now.'

    *Syntax Best Practices – below the Class Level*, presents iterators, generators,
    descriptors, and so on, in an advanced way. It also covers useful notes about
    Python idioms and internal CPython types implementations with their computational
    complexities as a rationale for showcased idioms.'

- en: '[Chapter 3](ch03.html "Chapter 3. Syntax Best Practices – above the Class Level"),
    *Syntax Best Practices – above the Class Level*, explains syntax best practices,
    but focuses above the class level. It covers more advanced object-oriented concepts
    and mechanisms available in Python. This knowledge is required in order to understand
    the last section of the chapter, which presents different approaches to metaprogramming
    in Python.'

- en: '[Chapter 4](ch04.html "Chapter 4. Choosing Good Names"), *Choosing Good Names*,
    involves choosing good names. It is an extension to PEP 8 with naming best practices,
    but also gives tips on designing good APIs.'

- en: '[Chapter 5](ch05.html "Chapter 5. Writing a Package"), *Writing a Package*,
    explains how to create the Python package and which tools to use in order to properly
    distribute it on the official Python Package Index or any other package repository.
    Information about packages is supplemented with a brief review of the tools that
    allow you to create standalone executables from Python sources.'

- en: '[Chapter 6](ch06.html "Chapter 6. Deploying Code"), *Deploying Code*, aims
    mostly at Python web developers and backend engineers, because it deals with code
    deployments. It explains how Python applications should be built in order to be
    easily deployed to remote servers and what tools you can use in order to automate
    that process. This chapter dovetails with [Chapter 5](ch05.html "Chapter 5. Writing
    a Package"), *Writing a Package*, because it shows how packages and private package
    repositories can be used to streamline your application deployments.'

    Extensions in Other Languages*, explains why writing C extensions for Python might
    be a good solution sometimes. It also shows that it is not as hard as it seems
    to be as long as the proper tools are used.'

    and Profiling Techniques*, by providing some common solutions to the performance
    problems that are often found in Python programs.'

    it might be necessary to write concurrent applications, and what are the main
    approaches to concurrency for Python programmers.'

    environment or know how to install it. Anyway, this book takes into account the
    fact that not everyone needs to be fully aware of the latest Python features or
    officially recommended tools. This is why the first chapter provides a recap of
    common utilities (such as virtual environments and pip) that are now considered
    standard tools of professional Python developers.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book is written for Python developers who wish to go further in mastering
    Python. And by developers I mean mostly professionals, so programmers who write
    software in Python for a living. This is because it focuses mostly on tools and
    practices that are crucial for creating performant, reliable, and maintainable
    software in Python.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It does not mean that hobbyists won't find anything interesting. This book should
    be great for anyone who is interested in learning advance-level concepts with
    Python. Anyone who has basic Python skills should be able to follow the content
    of the book, although it might require some additional effort from less experienced
    programmers. It should also be a good introduction to Python 3.5 for those who
    are still a bit behind and continue to use Python in version 2.7 or older.

    and concurrency.'
