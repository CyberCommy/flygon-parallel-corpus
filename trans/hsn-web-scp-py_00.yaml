- en: Web scraping is an essential technique used in many organizations to scrape
    valuable data from web pages. Web scraping, or web harvesting, is done with a
    view to extracting and collecting data from websites. Web scraping comes in handy
    with model development, which requires data to be collected on the fly. It is
    also applicable for the data that is true and relevant to the topic, in which
    the accuracy is desired over the short-term, as opposed to implementing datasets.
    Data collected is stored in files including JSON, CSV, and XML, is also written
    a the database for later use, and is also made available online as datasets. This
    book will open the gates for you in terms of delving deep into web scraping techniques
    and methodologies using Python libraries and other popular tools, such as Selenium.
    By the end of this book, you will have learned how to efficiently scrape different
    websites.
