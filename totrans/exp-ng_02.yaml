    scratch. So, one of the most bugging questions among the Angular developers is
    how can we migrate existing AngularJS applications into Angular. In this chapter,
    we are going to discuss best practices, approaches, and tools recommended to successfully
    migrate existing AngularJS applications.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: AngularJS and Angular differ syntactically and conceptually. So the migration
    process involves code change not only on a syntactical level but also in implementation.
    The Angular team made the life of the developers easier by providing built-in
    tools in Angular for migrating AngularJS applications to Angular. There is some
    preliminary process to do in our existing AngularJS applications before starting
    up the migration process.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The preliminary process involves decoupling the existing code and making the
    existing code maintainable. This preliminary process not only prepares the code
    for upgradation, but will also improve the performance of the existing AngularJS
    applications.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We can follow an incremental approach by running both AngularJS and Angular
    in the same application and initiate the migration process one by one starting
    from the components. This approach helps to migrate large applications, isolating
    the business from any impact and completing the upgradation over a period of time.
    This approach can be achieved using the Angular upgrade module.

    author name to the UI using the double-curly braces. However, the AngularJS prefixes
    with the alias of controller when referring the properties of the controller to
    bind to the template and Angular does not use prefixes with the alias, as the
    view or template is associated with the component by default.

    event to a method in an associated controller. Angular achieves the same by using
    native DOM elements which can be targeted with the `( )` syntax and it accomplishes
    this by combining One-way Data Binding with the `event` binding.

    and fastest way to upgrade. If the AngularJS app is larger and can't rewrite the
    whole code at once, we need to rewrite step by step, component by component, service
    by service. This is called incremental upgrading. However, running `ng1` and `ng2`
    side by side has performance implications.

    number of files in a project. This creates the hassle of organizing the files
    and referring them in the correct order in the HTML pages. When you use a module
    loader such as `SystemJS`, `Webpack`, or `Browserify`, it enables us to use TypeScript
    built-in module systems. This enables the developers to import or export features
    explicitly and share them between various parts of the application in the code.

    is a service that can bootstrap and manage hybrid applications that support both
    Angular and AngularJS code. `UpgradeAdapter` enables you to run both AngularJS
    and Angular code simultaneously. `UpgradeAdapter` facilitates interoperability
    between components and services from one framework to another framework. The interoperability
    in Dependency Injection, the DOM, and change detection will be taken care of by
    `UpgradeAdapter`.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Designing AngularJS applications by component centric is good practice rather
    than designing them by controller centric. If you had developed your application
    following this practice, then it will be easier for you to migrate. Component
    Directives in AngularJS will have their template, controller, and binding similar
    to Angular components. But make sure your AngularJS application Component Directives
    did not use the attributes such as compile, replace, priority, and terminal. If
    your application implemented Component Directives with these attributes then it
    is not liaising with Angular architecture. If your AngularJS application was developed
    using AngularJS 1.5 and the components are implemented using the component API,
    then you might have noticed the similarities in Angular components.
