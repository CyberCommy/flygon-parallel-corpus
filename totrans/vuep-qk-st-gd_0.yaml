    words, VuePress is a simple tool that lets you create static sites and **Single
    Page Applications** (**SPAs**) within minutes.

- en: Anything and everything that you build in VuePress is search engine-friendly,
    fully optimized, and mobile-friendly as well as really fast due to the fact that
    there are no database-driven operations or external engines to work with. You
    can simply enter your content in Markdown, and VuePress will parse the Markdown
    files as valid HTML.

    customize its appearance, tweak the default minimal theme, and make use of Vue.js
    expertise to extend the functionality of your site. Considering the fact that
    Vue.js is rising in popularity rather steadily, VuePress is already standing on
    the shoulders of a giant and has a lot of potential for growth!
