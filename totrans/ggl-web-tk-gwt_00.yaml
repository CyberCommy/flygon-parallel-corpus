- en: The client-server architecture has undergone a vast change over a short period
    of time. Earlier, each application had a different client software, with the software
    serving as the UI. This software had to be installed individually on every client,
    and needed to be updated every time we made changes to the application. We moved
    from that to the web era and deploying applications on the Internet, and then
    Internet enabled us to use the omnipresent web browser for accessing our applications
    from anywhere. This was a sea change, but we still had issues of performance and
    applications not having the same feel or responsiveness as desktop applications.
    Enter AJAX, and now we can build web pages that can rival a desktop application
    in responsiveness and nifty looks. AJAX underpins the current trend in developing
    applications for the Internet known as Web 2.0\. In order to build Ajaxified applications
    you need to know HTML, XML, and JavaScript at the very least.

- en: The Google Web Toolkit (GWT) makes it even easier to design an AJAX application
    using just the Java programming language. It is an open-source Java development
    framework and its best feature is that we don't have to worry too much about incompatibilities
    between web browsers and platforms. In GWT, we write the code in Java and then
    GWT converts it into browser-compliant JavaScript and HTML. This helps a lot,
    because we can stop worrying about modular programming. It provides a programming
    framework that is similar to that used by developers building Java applications
    using one of the GUI toolkits such as Swing, AWT, or SWT. GWT provides all the
    common user-interface widgets, listeners to react to events happening in the widgets,
    and ways to combine them into more complex widgets to do things that the GWT team
    may never have envisioned! Moreover, it makes reusing chunks of program easy.
    This greatly reduces the number of different technologies that you will need to
    master. If you know Java, then you can use your favorite IDE (we use Eclipse in
    this book) to write and debug an AJAX GWT application in Java. Yes, that means
    you can actually put breakpoints in your code and debug seamlessly from the client
    side to the server side. You can deploy your applications in any servlet container,
    create and run unit tests, and essentially develop GWT applications like any Java
    application. So start reading this book, fire up Eclipse, and enter the wonderful
    world of AJAX and GWT programming!

- en: In this book, we will start with downloading and installing GWT and walk through
    the creation, testing, debugging, and deployment of GWT applications. We will
    be creating a lot of highly interactive and fun user interfaces. We will also
    customize widgets and use JSNI to integrate GWT with other libraries such as Rico
    and Moo.fx. We will also learn to create our own custom widgets, and create a
    calendar and a weather widget. We will explore the I18N and XML support in GWT,
    create unit tests, and finally learn how to deploy GWT applications to a servlet
    container such as Tomcat. This book uses a typical task-based pattern, where we
    first show how to implement a task and then explain its working.

    The safest version is to use with GWT is Java 1.4.2, as they are completely compatible
    with each other. Different versions of GWT are available for different operating
    systems, so you can use your favorite OS without any hassles.'
