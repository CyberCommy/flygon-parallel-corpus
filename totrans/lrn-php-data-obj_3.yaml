    look at an important aspect of user-friendly web applications—error handling.
    Not only does it inform the user about an error condition, it also limits the
    damage if an error is not detected when it occurred.

    occurs, the script terminates and an error page is presented. The error should
    be logged in the error log, and the developers or maintainers should check the
    logs periodically. The most common sources of errors in database-driven web applications
    are the following:'

    records as well as add new records. As we will deal with user input supplied via
    web forms, we have to take care of its validation. Also, we may add error handling
    so that we can react to non-standard situations and present the user with a friendly
    message.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Before we proceed, let's briefly examine the sources of errors mentioned above
    and see what error handling strategy should be applied in each case. Our error
    handling strategy will use exceptions, so you should be familiar with them. If
    you are not, you can refer to Appendix A, which will introduce you to the new
    object-oriented features of PHP5.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We have consciously chosen to use exceptions, even though PDO can be instructed
    not to use them, because there is one situation where they cannot be avoided.
    The PDO constructors always throw an exception when the database object cannot
    be created, so we may as well use exceptions as our main error‑trapping method
    throughout the code.

- en: Sources of Errors
  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To create an error handling strategy, we should first analyze where errors can
    happen. Errors can happen on every call to the database, and although this is
    rather unlikely, we will look at this scenario. But before doing so, let's check
    each of the possible error sources and define a strategy for dealing with them.

- en: Server Software Failure or Overload
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This can happen on a really busy server, which cannot handle any more incoming
    connections. For example, there may be a lengthy update running in the background.
    The outcome is that we are unable to get any data from the database, so we should
    do the following.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If the PDO constructor fails, we present a page displaying a message, which
    says that the user's request could not be fulfilled at this time and that they
    should try again later. Of course, we should also log this error because it may
    require immediate attention. (A good idea would be emailing the database administrator
    about the error.)
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The problem with this error is that, while it usually manifests itself before
    a connection is established with the database (in a call to PDO constructor),
    there is a small risk that it can happen after the connection has been established
    (on a call to a method of the `PDO` or `PDOStatement` object when the database
    server is being shutdown). In this case, our reaction will be the same—present
    the user with an error message asking them to try again later.

    database access details differ; this may be when we are uploading from a development
    server to production server, where database setups differ. This is not an error

    taken while uploading as this may interrupt the site's operation.

    twice by mistake. To do this, we can create a unique index of the ISBN column
    of the `books` table. As every book has a unique ISBN, any attempt to insert the
    same ISBN will generate an error. We can trap this error and react accordingly,
    by displaying an error message asking the user to correct the ISBN or cancel its

    how PDO handles errors.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Types of Error Handling in PDO
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: By default, PDO uses the **silent error handling mode**. This means that any
    error that arises when calling methods of the `PDO` or `PDOStatement` classes
    go unreported. With this mode, one would have to call `PDO::errorInfo(), PDO::errorCode(),
    PDOStatement::errorInfo()`, or `PDOStatement::errorCode()`, every time an error
    occurred to see if it really did occur. Note that this mode is similar to traditional
    database access—usually, the code calls `mysql_errno()` and `mysql_error()` (or
    equivalent functions for other database systems) after calling functions that
    could cause an error, after connecting to a database and after issuing a query.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another mode is the **warning mode**. Here, `PDO` will act identical to the
    traditional database access. Any error that happens during communication with
    the database would raise an `E_WARNING` error. Depending on the configuration,
    an error message could be displayed or logged into a file.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Finally, PDO introduces a modern way of handling database connection errors—by
    using **exceptions**. Every failed call to any of the `PDO` or `PDOStatement`
    methods will throw an exception.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'As we have previously noted, PDO uses the silent mode, by default. To switch

    Note how we explicitly cast the request parameter `book` to `integer` so that
    no SQL injection can occur (line 13). If no book ID is provided, we set it to
    an empty array. Note how we call the `closeCursor()` function and then assign
    the `$q` variable to null. This is necessary as we are going to reuse the connection
    object.

    the script validates every field (lines 37 to 68). Every failed validation is
    appended to a list of warnings. (The `$warnings` variable is initialized with
    an empty array.) We will use this list to see whether validations were successful
    and to store error messages if they weren't.
