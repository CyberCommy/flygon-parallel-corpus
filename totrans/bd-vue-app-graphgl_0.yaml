    Huge companies such as Airbnb and Audi have started to adopt it, while medium
    to small companies is now recognizing the potential of this query-based API.

    of it, you wouldn't want to use REST APIs anymore.

- en: With the recipes in this book, you will learn how to build a complete real-time
    chat app from scratch. Starting by creating an AWS Amplify environment, you will
    delve into developing your first GraphQL Schema. You will then learn how to add
    the AppSync GraphQL client and create your first GraphQL mutation. The book also
    helps you to discover the simplicity and data fetching capabilities of GraphQL
    that make it easy for front-end developers to communicate with the server. You
    will later understand how to use Quasar Framework to create application components
    and layouts. Finally, you will find out how to create Vuex modules in your application
    to manage the app state, fetch data using the GraphQL client, and deploy your
    application to the web.
