    character devices, by means of `struct file_operations` structure, can export
    a collection of file operations, which are entry points for file-related system
    calls such as `open()` , `close()` , `read()` , `write()` , `mmap()` , `ioctl()`
    , and so on.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That being said, do not confuse `fb_ops` with `file_operations` structure. `fb_ops`
    offers an abstraction of low-level operations, while `file_operations` is for
    an upper-level system call interface. The kernel implements framebuffer file operations
    in `drivers/video/fbdev/core/fbmem.c` , which internally call methods we defined
    in `fb_ops` . In this manner, one can implement the low-level hardware operations
    according to the need of the system call interface, namely the `file_operations`
    structure. For example, when the user `open()` the device, the core's open file
    operation method will perform some core operations, and execute `fb_ops.fb_open()`
    method if set, same for `release` , `mmap` , and so on.

    by the core's `fops.ioctl` method. For some of those commands, the core's ioctl
    method may internally execute methods defined in `fb_ops` structure.
  prefs: []

    executes `fb_ops.fb_ioctl` only when the given ioctl command is not known to the
    kernel. In other words, `fb_ops.fb_ioctl` is executed in the default statement
    of the framebuffer core's `fops.ioctl` method.
