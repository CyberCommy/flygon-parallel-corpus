- en: The process of developing and maintaining games has changed very rapidly in
    the last few years. It has become more and more common for game developers to
    license third-party game engines, such as CryENGINE, in order to focus fully on
    the game itself.

- en: As the first game engine to ship with a pure **What You See Is What You Play**
    (**WYSIWYP**) philosophy in mind, CryENGINE focuses on productivity and iteration
    by allowing developers to jump directly into their games, previewing changes as
    they happen, and not waiting for levels and assets to build.

- en: For a programmer, CryENGINE is the ideal toolset. Development can be done in
    C++ using the generous API, allowing developers to jump straight into the code
    and write high-performing code that is not limited to obscure scripting languages.
    Got an idea? Fire up Visual Studio and get right to work.

    about very basic features such as loading a level in the Editor, and placing an
    entity. If you have never worked with CryENGINE before, we recommend either playing
    around with the CryENGINE Free SDK on your own, or purchasing *CryENGINE 3 Game
