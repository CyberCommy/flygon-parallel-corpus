- en: A vulnerability assessment is only part of a full security sweep. After vulnerabilities
    are identified or misconfigurations are discovered, the security assessor should
    strive to actually exploit these vulnerabilities. The reasons for taking the assessment
    to the exploitation stage are numerous, but the most important parts are to eliminate
    false positive findings and to demonstrate the full criticality of potentially
    severe findings.

    to the system at a very quick rate. Leveraging the power of Metasploit with scanning
    tools such as Nmap, and vulnerability scanners such as Nessus, can complete the
    Trifecta of a well-prepared security tool suite.

    the table as a last step: once the vulnerabilities are enumerated from other tools,
    Metasploit can actually exploit them. Sensitive data, compromised machines, and

    platform. Every day, Metasploit modules are being written and submitted to the
    Metasploit project; each of which can either perform a scan or, more often, actually
    attack a given vulnerability.

- en: 'Metasploit''s ability to act as an attack was revolutionary when it first debuted:
    rather than searching for proofs of concepts—or writing their own, after a vulnerability
    was announced—security professionals were immediately able to use a reliable platform
    with vetted modules to launch their attacks. Metasploit is written in Ruby, so
    it''s portable to almost any platform—and since all the modules run on the framework,
    there is no reason to hope a proof of concept will run on whatever type of machine
    the user happens to currently be using.'

    of Metasploit to look for a given module. There are a lot of ways you can use
    the search functionality, but for our purposes, we''re just going to look for
    something relatively straightforward: MS08-067, a well-known vulnerability in
    Windows that can give us quite a lot of access if we use it correctly!'

    by listing them out with `show options`. It's worth noting in the preceding screenshot
    that each Metasploit module can have a rank—in our case, the matching module came
    back "great." Great! Lastly, you might notice that the initial response from Metasploit
    is that we don't have a database connected, so we're using `slow search`. While
    it's true that connecting the Postgres database that we made earlier to Metasploit
    would make a lot of sense, it's not always the fastest way to proceed if we're
    just looking to run a quick exploit.

  zh: 我们可以通过调用 `use` 来选择模块，然后通过列出 `show options` 来设置我们需要的选项。值得注意的是，在前面的屏幕截图中，每个Metasploit模块都可以有一个等级——在我们的情况下，匹配的模块返回了“great”。太棒了！最后，您可能会注意到，Metasploit的初始响应是我们没有连接数据库，所以我们正在使用
    `slow search`。虽然连接我们之前创建的Postgres数据库到Metasploit可能是有道理的，但如果我们只是想快速运行一个 exploit，这并不总是最快的方法。
- en: After setting our target with `rhost`, we can run the exploit by typing `exploit`.
    Note that this is different than simply running a scan—Metasploit wants to ensure
    that you're well aware that you're launching an exploit.

    From Meterpreter, it is possible to run a large variety of commands—including
    attacks from Metasploit itself—in order to exfiltrate data to another system,
    or to pivot further into a compromised network. A chain of Meterpreter shells
    can easily compromise an entire network, and exfiltrate all sensitive data back
    to the source of the attacks—in this case, us!
