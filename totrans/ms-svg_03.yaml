    and elements. With just the tools you've experienced so far, you could start to
    do some real tasks with SVG. That said, SVG has a lot more to offer. This chapter
    will start to look at more advanced SVG tools. Some of these techniques will play
    an important role in doing dynamic SVG animations and visualizations.

    ways, including scaling, rotating, skewing, and translating (which looks like
    moving the element, but isn't exactly that). Using transformations allows you
    to manipulate the SVG without changing its intrinsic values (for example, height,
    width, *x*, and *y*) which is important when you're manipulating elements in a
    dynamic way.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To do this, you need to do a trick where you shift the point of origin for the
    element to a new point of origin that matches the CSS point of origin. Here's
    how this works. In this case, our rectangles are at `(100, 100)` in the coordinate
    system and are `100` pixels on a side. The center of the box is therefore at `(150,
    150)`. Translating the element by `(150,150)` sets the point of origin for these
    elements to the equivalent of the CSS point of origin.  Remember that the CSS
    point of origin is the center of the box (which was `(150,150)` before the transformation)
    and that translating an element actually *changes* its point of origin.

    the element *back* to its *original* point of origin `(0,0)` and, because they
    were manipulated at the CSS equivalent point of origin `(150, 150)`, the scaled
    elements are now centered appropriately:'

    Insert it into your document, call it when you need to use some SVG, and it just
    works. `svg4everybody` also polyfills the experience in Safari 6 and Edge 12\.
    How to fix your page is shown in the following code sample. You include the file

    Filters allow you to blur images, apply lighting effects, and many other advanced
    image manipulation techniques. If you've ever used Adobe Photoshop or other graphics
    manipulation programs, these filters are just like the filters you've seen in
    that environment.

    of them out there; there are varying (sometimes confusing) levels of browser support
    and they can be very complicated to explain. I did want to show you one so that
    you can see the basic pattern and this one is as straightforward as they come.
    *All* of the other filters follow the same general pattern. A `filter` or series
    of filters are grouped in the `defs` section and referenced with an `id` element.
    Just know that simple pattern and you're ready to experiment with them or to incorporate
    them into your projects.

    chapters about the way that SVG interacts with the wider universe of web technology:
    if you''re going to serve SVG on the web, you need to ensure that it''s served
    with the correct content type. Browsers expect SVG to be served with the `"image/svg+xml"` media
    type. If you run into problems with SVG images not displaying and you can verify
    that they exist on the server, it''s a good bet to check the headers (using the
    Network tab of your browser debugger of choice) to see if they''re being served
    correctly. If they''re not (for example, if they''re `text/xml`), then you need
    to set the media type properly. This section outlines how to set the proper media
    type in common web servers.'

    You learned about multiple transformations, which allow you to manipulate SVG
    elements without changing their underlying structure. This opens up a number of
    possibilities that we'll continue to examine throughout this book.
