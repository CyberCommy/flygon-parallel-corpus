- en: Developers are increasingly being asked to build native applications that run
    on multiple operating systems and in the browser. In the past, this would have
    meant learning new technologies and making multiple copies of an application.
    But Uno Platform allows you to use tools, languages, and APIs you already know
    from building Windows apps to develop apps that can also run on other platforms.
    This book will help you to create customer-facing as well as line-of-business
    apps that can be used on the device, browser, or operating system of your choice.
