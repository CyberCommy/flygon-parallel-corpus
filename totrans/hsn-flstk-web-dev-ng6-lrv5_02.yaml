- en: TypeScript enables you to write JavaScript code. It includes static typing and
    other features that are very common in object-oriented languages. In addition,
    with TypeScript, you can use all of the features of ECMAScript 6, because the
    compiler converts them into readable code for the current browser.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'One of the features of TypeScript is that users can create typed variables,
    like it is done in Java or C# (for example, `const VARIABLE_NAME: Type = Value`),
    Not only that, but TypeScript helps us to write clean, well-organized code. That
    is one of the reasons why the Angular team adopted TypeScript for the current
    version of the framework.'

    These functions are extremely common in applications with Angular.
