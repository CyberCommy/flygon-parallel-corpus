- en: Kubernetes is an open source container orchestration platform originally developed
    by Google and made available to the public in 2014\. It has made the deployment
    of container-based, complex, distributed systems simpler for developers. Since
    its inception, the community has built a large ecosystem around Kubernetes with
    many open source projects. This book is specially designed to quickly help Kubernetes
    administrators and **site reliability engineers** (**SREs**) to find the right
    tools and get up to speed with Kubernetes. The book covers everything from getting
    Kubernetes clusters up on most popular cloud and on-premises solutions to recipes
    that help you automate testing and move your applications out to production environments.
