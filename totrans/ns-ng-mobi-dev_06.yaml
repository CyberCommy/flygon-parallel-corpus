- en: The `tns run <platform>` command will automatically build your app and sync
    it up to the devices and emulators. It will do all the heavy-lifting to try and
    make your app be in a running state on the device, and then it will launch the
    app. This command has changed over the years and has now become a fairly smart
    command that will automatically make certain choices to simplify your development
    life. One of the cool features of this command is that it will sync your application
    to all running and connected devices. If you have five different devices hooked
    up, all five of them will receive the changes. This only works per each platform,
    but you can run `tns run ios` in one and `tns run android` in another command
    window, and then any changes will automatically be synced to all devices connected
    to your machine. As you may imagine, this is very useful during the testing and
    cleaning up phase to make sure that everything continues to look good on different
    phones and tablets. If you have no physical devices hooked up to your computer,
    it will automatically launch an emulator for you.
  id: totrans-14
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Normally, since the app already exists on the devices, it will just do a quick
    live sync of the changed files. This is a very fast process, as it just transfers
    all the changes in your files from your own `app` folder to all the connected
    devices, and then starts the app.  This process is, in the majority of situations,
    a really good thing. However, `tns run <platform>` will not always automatically
    detect any changes to your `node_modules` folder, for example, when you upgrade
    a plugin. If this is the case, you will need to cancel the current running `tns
    run` and then start a new `tns run`. Occasionally, the `tns run` will still believe
    that all it needs to do is sync, whereas the reality is that it should have to
    rebuild the app.  In this case, you will want to use the handy-dandy `--clean`
    option.  This is very important for times when the device does not seems to pick
    up any of your changes. The `tns run <platform> --clean` command will normally
    force the app to be rebuilt; however, if `--clean` fails to rebuild, then check
    out the `tns build` command described later in the chapter. There are a couple
    of other command parameters that aren't used much, but you might need them for
    a specific situation. The `--justlaunch` will start the app and do nothing else;
     `--no-watch` will disable live syncing, and finally `--device <device id>` will
    force the app to be installed only on a specific device. You can view which devices
    are available for the installation of the app by running `tns devices`.

  zh: 通常情况下，由于应用程序已经存在于设备上，它只会快速地同步更改的文件。这是一个非常快速的过程，因为它只是将您的文件夹中的所有更改从您自己的`app`文件夹传输到所有连接的设备，然后启动应用程序。在大多数情况下，这个过程是非常好的。然而，`tns
    run <platform>`不会总是自动检测到`node_modules`文件夹的任何更改，例如当您升级插件时。如果是这种情况，您需要取消当前运行的`tns
    run`，然后启动一个新的`tns run`。偶尔，`tns run`仍然会认为它只需要同步，而实际上它应该重新构建应用程序。在这种情况下，您将需要使用方便的`--clean`选项。这对于设备似乎没有接收到任何更改的情况非常重要。`tns
    run <platform> --clean`命令通常会强制重新构建应用程序；然而，如果`--clean`无法重新构建，那么请查看本章后面描述的`tns build`命令。还有一些其他命令参数并不经常使用，但您可能需要它们来处理特定情况。`--justlaunch`将启动应用程序并且不做其他操作；`--no-watch`将禁用实时同步，最后`--device
    <device id>`将强制应用程序仅安装在特定设备上。您可以通过运行`tns devices`来查看哪些设备可用于安装应用程序。

    it can also be used to force a fully clean build of the application, if the `tns

- en: The reason there are two passwords is that your keystore can actually contain
    an unlimited number of keys, and so, each key in the keystore has its own password.
    Anyone who has access to this key can pretend to be you. This is helpful for building

    who gets what. So, for the sake of simplicity, I personally recommend that you
    have a separate keystore and alias per application. I normally keep the keystore
    in with the app and under version control. Since both opening and accessing an
    alias are password protected, you are fine unless you choose your passwords poorly.

- en: Now that you have an idea of the power of a command line, all you really need
    to remember is `tns debug ios` and `tns run android`; these will be your constant
    friends in our adventure. Throw in a couple of `tns plugin add` commands and then
    wrap up the application when finally finished with a `tns build`, and you are
    golden**.** However, don't forget about the rest of the commands; they all serve
    a purpose. Some of them are rarely used, but some of them are extremely helpful
    when you need them.
