- en: In this book, you will be introduced to Bitcoin and Blockchain, and how to take
    part in the Bitcoin ecosystem. You will learn about Bitcoin and its features,
    Blockchain, and how both can work together. You'll also learn how to use Pi Bitcoin
    tools to program Bitcoin with Python. You will learn about interacting with Blockchain
    APIs programmatically with Python, and about Bitcoin mining and how to get started
    with it. We will also explore Bitcoin trading bots. This book also deals with
    exploring and analyzing the tremendous amount of data being generated in the Bitcoin
    ecosystem; how to get, clean, manipulate, and visualize Bitcoin price data; and
    how to analyze a Bitcoin dice game's data using Python's data analysis tools.
