- en: After the introduction of HTML 4.01 in 1999, the Web changed fast. Many new
    devices such as tablets and mobile phones saw the light of day. Mobile Internet
    became faster, cheaper, and more stable. The W3C started the HTML5 working group
    in 2007\. In December 2012, W3C designated HTML5 as a candidate recommendation.
    HTML5 works with CSS3\. Today, all major browsers (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Opera,
    IE) offer HTML5 support.

    HTML documents, but CSS3 also plays an important role in the responsibility of
    your designs. Last but not least, CSS3 extends CSS with features such as animations
    and transitions.

    complex. A web developer needs to know about complex CSS3, the difference between
    browsers and devices, animations, and other style effects. Writing correct and
    functional CSS code will be the first thing; keeping this code readable, maintainable,
    and working on all major browsers will be the second thing. CSS files grow and
    become untidy in the development and maintenance processes. CSS doesn't have the
    ability to modify the existing values or reuse common styles. Also, doing math
    or defining variables is not possible in CSS. This is where Less comes into the
    frame.

    is also valid Less. The initial versions of Less were written in Ruby; now, Less

    for production. The end product in this case will be valid, compact, and readable
    CSS code. Besides, the precompiling Less code can also compile in real time. Less
    offers server-side and client-side options to do this. Real-time client-side compilation
    via LESS.js in a modern web browser makes testing easy. Server-side compilations
    offer opportunities to build applications with Less as well as create dynamic
    CSS.

  zh: 本书涵盖内容
- en: '[Chapter 1](ch01.html "Chapter 1. Improving Web Development with Less"), *Improving
    Web Development with Less*, shows how CSS3 brought advanced functions such as
    gradients, transitions, and animations to web designers. It also explains how,
    on the other hand, CSS code became more complex and difficult to maintain. Less
    helps you make your CSS maintainable, reusable, and prevent code duplications.'

  zh: 第1章，“用Less改进Web开发”，展示了CSS3如何为网页设计师带来了高级功能，如渐变、过渡和动画。它还解释了CSS代码变得更加复杂和难以维护。Less帮助你使你的CSS可维护、可重用，并防止代码重复。
- en: '[Chapter 2](ch02.html "Chapter 2. Using Variables and Mixins"), *Using Variables
    and Mixins*, explains why variables allow you to specify widely-used values in
    a single place and then reuse them throughout the style sheet, thus making global
    changes as easy as changing one line of code. Mixins allow you to embed all the
    properties of a class into another class by simply including the class name as
    one of its properties. The chapter also explains what parametric mixins are and
    how to use them.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 第2章，“使用变量和混合”，解释了为什么变量允许你在一个地方指定广泛使用的值，然后在整个样式表中重复使用它们，从而使全局更改变得像改变一行代码一样容易。混合允许你将一个类的所有属性嵌入到另一个类中，只需将类名包含为其属性之一。本章还解释了参数化混合是什么以及如何使用它们。
- en: '[Chapter 3](ch03.html "Chapter 3. Nested Rules, Operations, and Built-in Functions"),
    *Nested Rules, Operations, and Built-in Functions*, explains the use of nested
    rules for making inheritance clear and for making shorter style sheets. The chapter
    also explains how to create complex relationships between properties and how to
    use the built-in functions of Less.'

    the Wheel*, teaches you how Less code and mixins can become complex because they
    handle different browsers and devices. The chapter also explains prebuilt mixins
    and other sources that help you (re)use them.'

    get the most out of this book. We will introduce these CSS aspects briefly in
    the first chapter as well. Understanding the basics of using functions and parameters

    Don't panic if you know nothing about functions and parameters. This book contains
    clear examples. Even without any (functional) programming knowledge you can learn
    how to use Less, and this book will help you do this. The most important skill
    will be the willingness to learn.
