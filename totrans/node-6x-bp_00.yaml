- en: Web applications with Node.js are increasingly popular and accessible to all
    developers. Today, with the growing evolution of Node.js, we can see numerous
    companies using this technology for the development of their applications. Among
    them, we can mention Netflix, Paypal, and many others who use Node.js in production
    environments.

    platforms. Plus, many building tools, such as task runners, generators and dependence
    managers, emerged using the Node.js engine, such as Grunt, Gulp, Bower, and more.
