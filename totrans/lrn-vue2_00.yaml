    Vue.js is, how it compares to other frameworks, and what it allows us to do. We
    will learn different aspects of Vue.js while building small funny applications
    on top of it and applying these aspects in practice. In the end, we will look
    back to see what''ve we learned and have a look into the future to see what we
    can still learn and do. So, you will learn the following:'

    Whether you have just started to work with web technologies or you are already
    a guru of frameworks and languages in the vast ocean of web technologies, this
    book might show you something new in the world of reactive web applications. If
    you are a Vue developer and have used Vue 1.0, this book might be a useful guide
    for you to migrate to Vue 2.0, since all the examples of the book are based on
    Vue 2.0\. Even if you are already using Vue 2.0, this book might be a nice exercise
    of building an application from scratch, applying all Vue and software engineering
    concepts and taking it to the deployment stage.
