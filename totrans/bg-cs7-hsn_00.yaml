- en: '*Beginning C# 7 Hands-On – Advanced Language Features* assumes that you’ve
    mastered the basic elements of the C# language and that you''re now ready to learn
    the more advanced C# language and syntax, line by line, in a working Visual Studio
    environment. You''ll learn how to code advanced C# language topics including generics,
    lambda expressions, and anonymous methods. You''ll learn to use query syntax to
    construct queries and deploy queries that perform aggregation functions. You''ll
    work with C# 7 and SQL Server 2017 to perform complex joins and stored procedures.
    Explore advanced file access methods, and see how to serialize and deserialize
    objects—all by writing working lines of code that you can run within Visual Studio. You''ll
    also take a look at C# through web programming with web forms. By the time you’ve
    finished this book, you’ll know all the critical advanced elements of the C# language
    and how to program everything from C# generics to XML, LINQ, and your first full
    MVC web applications. These are the advanced building blocks that you can then
    combine to exploit the full power of the C# programming language, line by line. This
    book is designed for beginner C# developers who have mastered the basics now,
    and for anyone who needs a fast reference to using advanced C# language features
    in practical coding examples.'
