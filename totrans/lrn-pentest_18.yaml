    technology field. Experiencing the thrill of being a **hacker**, knowing how to
    exploit machines and take control of systems, gives an individual a sense of power.
    But, as we have covered in this book, it is more than blindly hacking systems.
    Penetration testing is more structured, taking into consideration the business
    needs and, of course, providing a solid outcome for the business to increase their
    security posture.

- en: Network penetration testing is the most common penetration testing method. Penetration
    testing on networks involves both internal and external networks. The aim is to
    emulate a successful attacker who has been able to circumvent the defenses put
    in place. It enables the penetration tester to explore many aspects of the organization,
    providing a clear picture on the security posture of the organization. Once the
    penetration tester obtains access to the network, many obstacles are removed.

    you are testing. For example, a simple website using SQL might not be as complex
    as a website using multiple APIs, Applets, or ActiveX controls. In this test,
    you can invest a large amount of time, as web applications that are external-facing
    pose a huge risk to the business.
