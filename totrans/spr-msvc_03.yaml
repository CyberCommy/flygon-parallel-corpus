    Avoiding too chatty services, too many synchronous request-response calls, and
    cyclic synchronous dependencies are three key points, as these could easily break
    the system. A successful equation is to keep high cohesion within a microservice,
    and loose coupling between microservices. In addition to this, ensure that transaction
    boundaries are not stretched across microservices. A first class microservice
    will react upon receiving an event as an input, execute a number of internal functions,
    and finally send out another event. As part of the compute function, it may read

    Traditional data warehouses like Oracle, Teradata, and others are used primarily
    for batch reporting. But with NoSQL databases (like Hadoop) and microbatching
    techniques, near real-time analytics is possible with the concept of data lakes.
    Unlike the traditional warehouses that are purpose-built for batch reporting,
    data lakes store raw data without assuming how the data is going to be used. Now
    the question really is how to port the data from microservices into data lakes.

    in many ways. Traditional ETL could be one of the options. Since we allow backdoor
    entry with ETL, and break the abstraction, this is not considered an effective
    way for data movement. A better approach is to send events from microservices
    as and when they occur, for example, customer registration, customer update events,
    and so on. Data ingestion tools consume these events, and propagate the state
    change to the data lake appropriately. The data ingestion tools are highly scalable

    number of infrastructures dedicated per microservice may not be very cost effective.
    Managing them internally in a data center may increase the cost of ownership and
    cost of operations. A cloud-like infrastructure is better for microservices deployment.'

    cost effective, and they are also hard to manage. With physical machines, it is
    also hard to handle automatic fault tolerance. Virtualization is adopted by many
    organizations because of its ability to provide optimal use of physical resources.
    It also provides resource isolation. It also reduces the overheads in managing
    large physical infrastructure components. Containers are the next generation of
    virtual machines. VMWare, Citrix, and so on provide virtual machine technologies.
    Docker, Drawbridge, Rocket, and LXD are some of the containerizer technologies.'

    help to invoke applications when a new container is launched, or kill the application
    when the container shuts down. Application life cycle management allows for script
    application deployments and releases. It automatically detects failure scenario,
    and responds to those failures thereby ensuring the availability of the application.
    This works in conjunction with the cluster control software. Marathon partially
    addresses this capability.'

    to understand the changes in the deployment topology, and respond accordingly.
    This moves away from the traditional approach of configuring static IP addresses,
    domain aliases, or cluster addresses in the load balancer. When new servers are
    added to the environment, it should automatically detect this, and include them
    in the logical cluster by avoiding any manual interactions. Similarly, if a service
    instance is unavailable, it should take it out from the load balancer. A combination
    of Ribbon, Eureka, and Zuul provide this capability in Spring Cloud Netflix.'
