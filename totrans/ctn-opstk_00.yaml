- en: Containers are one of the most talked about technologies of recent times. They
    have become increasingly popular as they are changing the way we develop, deploy,
    and run software applications. OpenStack gets tremendous traction as it is used
    by many organizations across the globe and as containers gain popularity and become
    more complex, it's necessary for OpenStack to provide various infrastructure resources
    for containers such as compute, network, and storage.

- en: '*Containerization in OpenStack* aims at answering the question, how can OpenStack
    keep pace with the increasing challenges of container technology? You will start
    with getting familiar with container and OpenStack basics so that you understand
    how the container ecosystem and OpenStack work together. To help you get better
    at compute, networking, managing application services and deployment tools, the
    book has dedicated chapters for different OpenStack projects: Magnum, Zun, Kuryr,
    Murano, and Kolla.'
