- en: In this chapter, we will get to see the real value of SFML **Views**. We will
    add a large array of SFML `Text` objects and manipulate them as we did before
    in the **Timber!!!** project. What is new is that we will draw the HUD using a
    second view instance. This way, the HUD will stay neatly positioned over the top
    of the main game action, regardless of what the background, player, zombies, and
    other game objects are doing.

    the HUD and the level up screen.

- en: The previous code is very simple and nothing new. It basically creates a whole
    bunch of SFML `Text` objects. It assigns their colors and sizes, then formats
    their positions, using functions we have seen before.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The most important thing to note is that we create another `View` object called
    `hudView` and initialize it to fit the resolution of the screen.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As we have seen, the main view object scrolls around as it follows the player.
    In contrast, we will never move `hudView`. The result of this is that as long
    as we switch to this view before we draw the elements of the HUD, we will create
    the effect of allowing the game world to scroll by underneath while the player's
    HUD remains stationary.

- en: As an analogy, you can think of laying a transparent sheet of plastic, with
    some writing on it, over a TV screen. The TV will carry on as normal with moving
    pictures, the text on the plastic sheet will stay in the same place regardless
    of what goes on underneath it.

- en: The next thing to notice, however, is that the high score is not set in any
    meaningful way. We will need to wait until the next chapter, when we investigate
    file I/O to save and retrieve the high score.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another point worth noting is that we declare and initialize a `RectangleShape`
    called `healthBar` that will be a visual representation of the player's remaining
    health. This will work in almost exactly the same way that the time-bar worked
    in the last project, except of course, it will represent health instead of time.
  prefs: []

- en: In the previous code, there is a new sprite called `ammoIcon` that gives context
    to the bullet and clip statistics that we will draw next to it, in the bottom
    left of the screen.

    we just added, be sure to familiarize yourself with the details, especially the
    variable names, to make the rest of the chapter easier to follow.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As you might expect, we will update the HUD variables in the update section
    of our code. We will not, however, do so every frame. The reason for this is that
    it is unnecessary and it also slows our game loop down.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As an example, consider the scenario where the player kills a zombie and gets
    some more points. It doesn't matter whether the `Text` object that holds the score
    is updated in a thousandth, hundredth, or even tenth of a second. The player will
    discern no difference. This means there is no point rebuilding strings that we
    set to the `Text` objects every frame.

    since the last time the HUD was updated and the interval, measured in frames,
    we would like to wait between HUD updates.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now we can use these new variables and actually update the HUD each frame. We
    won't actually see all the HUD elements change, however, until we begin to manipulate
    the final variables, such as `wave`, in the next chapter.

    `timeSinceLastUpdate` object, then increment the `framesSinceLastUpdate` variable.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Next, we start an `if` block that tests whether `framesSinceLastHUDUpdate` is
    greater than our preferred interval, which is stored in `fpsMeasurementFrameInterval`.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Inside this `if` block is where all the action takes place. First, we declare
    a string stream object for each string that we need to set to a `Text` object.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Then we use each of those string stream objects in turn, and use the `setString`
    function to set the result to the appropriate `Text` object.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Finally, before the `if` block is exited, the `framesSinceLastHUDUpdate` is
    set back to zero so that the count can begin again.

- en: A) Take a look at the enhanced edition of the **Zombie Arena** game in the download
    bundle. You can use the keyboard cursor keys to spin and zoom the action. Warning!
    Spinning the scene makes the controls awkward, but you get to see some of the
    things that can be done with the `View` class.

    in the input handling section of the main game loop. You can see the code in the
    `Zombie Arena Enhanced Version` folder of the download bundle or run the enhanced
    version from the `Runnable Games/Zombie Arena` folder.

    variables of different types using `sstream` and then draw them over the top of
    the main game action using a second SFML `View` object.

- en: We are nearly done with Zombie Arena now. All the screenshots show a small arena
    that doesn't take advantage of the full monitor. In the final chapter for this
    project, we will put in some finishing touches such as levelingup, sound effects,
    and saving the high-score . The arena can then grow to the same size as the monitor
    and far beyond.
