    be pretty comfortable with its basic features. In this chapter, we'll get a Laravel
    development environment up and running as we prepare to build the Vuebnb backend.

- en: Laravel may seem like a monolithic framework because it includes features for
    building almost any kind of web application. Under the hood, though, Laravel is
    a collection of many separate modules, some developed as part of the Laravel project
    and some from third-party authors. Part of what makes Laravel great is its careful
    curation and seamless connection of these constituent modules.

    in a Laravel installation. There''s no official reason why Vue was chosen over
    other worthy options, such as React, but my guess is that it''s because Vue and
    Laravel share the same philosophy: simplicity and an emphasis on the developer
    experience.'
