- en: This book will help you take your React knowledge to the next level by showing
    how to apply both basic and advanced React patterns to create cross-platform applications.
    The concepts of React are described in a way that's understandable to both new
    and experienced developers; no prior experience of React is required, although
    it would help.

- en: In each of the 12 chapters of this book, you'll create a project with React,
    React Native, or React 360\. The projects created in these chapters implement
    popular React features such as **Higher-Order Components** (**HOCs**) for re-using
    logic, the context API for state-management, and Hooks for life cycle. Popular
    libraries, such as React Router and React Navigation, are used for routing, while
    the JavaScript testing framework Jest is used to write unit tests for the applications.
    Also, some more advanced chapters involve a GraphQL server, and Expo is used to
    help you create React Native applications.

    that can scale. Best practices of how to structure your files, packages to use,
    and tools will be discussed and practiced. The best way to architect a React project
    will be shown by building a list of movies. Also, webpack and Babel are used to
