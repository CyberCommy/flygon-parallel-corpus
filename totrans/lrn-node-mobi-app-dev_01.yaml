    to efficiently construct modern, cross-platform solutions for your users. In this
    chapter, we will focus on the tools themselves, showing you how to bootstrap your
    development environment to tackle the challenges that we have in store for you
    in the remainder of the book. We will also give you a brief introduction to each
    tool in order to give you an idea about why they fit into your toolchain. If any
    such detail seems unclear at this point, do not worry. We will delve into everything
    you need to know about each tool in the relevant parts of the book.

    the fundamental software components that we will use throughout this book. You
    will also have a good understanding of why these tools are appropriate for the
    development of modern apps.

- en: Modern apps have several requirements, which cannot be provided by the app itself,
    such as central data storage, communication routing, and user management. In order
    to provide such services, apps rely on an external software component known as
    the backend. The backend will be executed on one or more remote servers, listen
    to network requests from the devices that run the app, and provide them with the
    services that requests require.

- en: The backend that we will use in this book is Node.js, a powerful but strange
    beast in its category. Node.js, at the time of writing this book, is the only
    major backend that is written almost entirely in JavaScript, which in reality
    is a frontend scripting language. The creators of Node.js wanted a backend that
    could be integrated with the apps written in JavaScript as seamlessly as possible,
    and you cannot get much closer to that than Node.js. Beyond this, Node.js is known
    for being both reliable and high-performing.

    ground up to be extendable through plugins or packages. Node.js comes with its
    own package management system, **Node Package Manager** (**NPM**), through which
    you can easily install, remove, and manage packages for your project. You will
    see how to use NPM in order to install other necessary components later in this
    chapter.
