  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: C++ is a mature multi-paradigm programming language that enables you to write
    high-level code with a high degree of control over the hardware. Today, significant
    parts of software infrastructure, including databases, browsers, multimedia frameworks,
    and GUI toolkits, are written in C++.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book starts by introducing C++ data structures and how to store data using
    linked lists, arrays, stacks, and queues. In later chapters, the book explains
    the basic algorithm design paradigms, such as the greedy approach and the divide-and-conquer
    approach, which are used to solve a large variety of computational problems. Finally,
    you will learn the advanced technique of dynamic programming to develop optimized
    implementations of several algorithms discussed in the book.

- en: By the end of this book, you will have learned how to implement standard data
    structures and algorithms in efficient and scalable C++ 14 code.

- en: A composer and pianist, John Carey's formal education is almost exclusively
    based within the musical realm. Having used computers and other forms of technology
    extensively in his artistic endeavors, he invested years of self-study in the
    subjects of programming and mathematics and now works professionally as a software
    engineer. He believes his unusual background provides him with a unique and relatively
    non-academic perspective on the topic of software development. He currently works
    for Hydratec Industries, a company that primarily develops CAD software for fire
    sprinkler system designers that is used to perform hydraulic calculations on proposed
    designs so as to determine their efficacy and legality.

- en: This book is intended for developers or students who want to revisit basic data
    structures and algorithm design techniques. Although no mathematical background
    is required, some basic knowledge of complexity classes and Big O notation, along
    with a qualification in an algorithms course, will help you get the most out of
    this book. Familiarity with the C++ 14 standard is assumed.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book uses a practical and hands-on approach to explain various concepts.
    Through exercises, the book shows that different data structures that theoretically
    should perform similarly actually perform quite differently on modern computers.
    The book does not delve into any theoretical analyses and instead focuses on benchmarking
    and practical results.
