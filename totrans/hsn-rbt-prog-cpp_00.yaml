- en: C++ is one of the most popular legacy programming languages for robotics, and
    a combination of C++ and robotics hardware is used in many leading industries.
    This book will bridge the gap between Raspberry Pi and C/C++ programming and enable
    you to develop applications for Raspberry Pi. To follow along with the projects
    covered in the book, you can implement C programs in Raspberry Pi with the wiringPi
    library.

- en: With this book, you’ll develop a fully functional car robot and write programs
    to move it in different directions. You’ll then create an obstacle-avoiding robot
    using an ultrasonic sensor. Furthermore, you’ll find out how to control the robot
    wirelessly using your PC/Mac. This book will also help you work with object detection
    and tracking using OpenCV, and guide you through exploring face detection techniques.
    Finally, you will create an Android app and control the robot wirelessly with
    an Android smartphone.

    Raspberry Pi*, covers different modes of Raspberry Pi and GPIO pin configuration.
    Then, we will set up Raspberry Pi B+ and Raspberry Pi Zero and install the Raspbian
    OS on it. We will also learn how to connect a Raspberry Pi to a laptop wirelessly
    via a Wi-Fi network.'

    with wiringPi*, covers the installation of the wiringPi library. In this chapter,
    we will understand the wiringPi pin connections for the Raspberry Pi. Then, we
    will write two C++ programs and will upload them onto our Raspberry Pi.'

    the criteria for selecting a robot chassis. After that, we will construct our
    car, connect the motor driver to the Raspberry Pi, and understand the workings
    of an H-bridge circuit. Finally, we will write programs to move the robot forward,
    backward, left, and right.'

    Robot*, looks at how an ultrasonic sensor works, and we will write a program to
    measure distance values. Next, we will program the 16 x 2 LCD to read the ultrasonic
    distance value. We will also look at the I2C LCD, which takes the 16 LCD pin as
    an input and provides four pins as an output, thus simplifying the wiring connections.
    Finally, we will fit the ultrasonic sensor on our robot to create our obstacle-avoiding
    robot. This robot will move freely when there are no obstacles near it, and if
    it approaches an obstacle, it will avoid it by taking a turn.'

    Using a Laptop*, looks at two different techniques for controlling the robot using
    a laptop. In the first technique, we will use the ncurses library to take input
    from the keyboard to move the robot accordingly. In the second technique, we will
    use the QT Creator IDE to create GUI buttons, and then use these buttons to move
    the robot in different directions.'

    also be introduced to the Raspberry Pi camera module and, after setting up the
    Pi camera, you will take pictures and record a short video clip using the Pi camera.'

    After that, we will put these functions to the test and attempt to recognize an
    object from an image. Then, we will learn how to read a video feed from the Pi
    camera, how to threshold a colored ball, and how to place a red dot on top of
    it. Finally, we will use the Pi camera and the ultrasonic sensor to detect the
    ball and follow it.'

    Tracking Using Haar Classifier*, uses the Haar face classifier to detect a face
    from a video feed and draw a rectangle around it. Next, we will detect eyes and
    a smile on the given face and create a circle surrounding the eyes and mouth.
    After using this knowledge of face and eye detection, we will first turn the LED
    on/off when the eyes and smile are detected. Next, by creating a white dot in
    the center of the face, we will make the robot follow the face.'

    in which text written inside the textbox will be displayed in a label and also
    read out by the smartphone. We will then develop a voice-controlled Android app
    for the bot, which will recognize our voice and send text to the RPi via Bluetooth.
    After this, using the terminal window, we will pair the Android smartphone''s
    Bluetooth with the RPi''s Bluetooth. Finally, we will look at socket programming
    and write the VoiceBot program to establish a connection with the Android smartphone''s
    Bluetooth in order to control the robot.'
