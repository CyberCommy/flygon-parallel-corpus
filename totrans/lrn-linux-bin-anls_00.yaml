- en: Software engineering is the act of creating an invention that exists, lives,
    and breathes on a microprocessor. We call it a program. Reverse engineering is
    the act of discovering how exactly that program lives and breathes, and furthermore
    it is how we can understand, dissect, or modify the behavior of that program using
    a combination of disassemblers and reversing tools and relying on our hacker instincts
    to master the target program which we are reverse engineering. We must understand
    the intricacies of binary formats, memory layout, and the instruction set of the
    given processor. We therefore become masters of the very life given to a program
    on a microprocessor. A reverse engineer is skilled in the art of binary mastery.
    This book is going to give you the proper lessons, insight, and tasks required
    to become a Linux binary hacker. When someone can call themselves a reverse engineer,
    they elevate themselves beyond the level of just engineering. A true hacker can
    not only write code but also dissect code, disassembling the binaries and memory
    segments in pursuit of modifying the inner workings of a software program; now
    that is power…

- en: On both a professional and a hobbyist level, I use my reverse engineering skills
    in the computer security field, whether it is vulnerability analysis, malware
    analysis, antivirus software, rootkit detection, or virus design. Much of this
    book will be focused towards computer security. We will analyze memory dumps,
    reconstruct process images, and explore some of the more esoteric regions of binary
    analysis, including Linux virus infection and binary forensics. We will dissect
    malware-infected executables and infect running processes. This book is aimed
    at explaining the necessary components for reverse engineering in Linux, so we
    will be going deep into learning ELF (executable and linking format), which is
    the binary format used in Linux for executables, shared libraries, core dumps,
    and object files. One of the most significant aspects of this book is the deep
    insight it gives into the structural complexities of the ELF binary format. The
    ELF sections, segments, and dynamic linking concepts are vital and exciting chunks
    of knowledge. We will explore the depths of hacking ELF binaries and see how these
    skills can be applied to a broad spectrum of work.

- en: The goal of this book is to teach you to be one of the few people with a strong
    foundation in Linux binary hacking, which will be revealed as a vast topic that
    opens the door to innovative research and puts you on the cutting edge of low-level
    hacking in the Linux operating system. You will walk away with valuable knowledge
    of Linux binary (and memory) patching, virus engineering/analysis, kernel forensics,
    and the ELF binary format as a whole. You will also gain more insights into program
    execution and dynamic linking and achieve a higher understanding of binary protection
    and debugging internals.
