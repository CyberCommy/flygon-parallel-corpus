    one that is the entire main application. The problem, as mentioned before, is
    that Go routines give control back to other Go routines voluntarily instead of

    `1` second is not enough for all the Go routines to finish the task. Once the
    main Go routine is done with its process, it shuts off the entire application
    and does not give enough time for other Go routines to complete. There is a way
    of handling this situation, where we have another construct called channels. So,
    for simplicity, we will remove the second Go routine and use the channels now.

    from the name channel, and therefore we don''t terminate the application. Once
    we get some data from the name channel, we read it and we don''t really assign
    it to anything. When the `main` Go routine proceeds to the next line, there is
    no code there and hence the `main` function is exited. Therefore, our application

- en: That's how you can use channels and functions to do concurrent operations. Before
    we conclude, let's reiterate one point about channels. If a channel is empty and
    you try to read it, it will block its Go routine. Once it is filled, we can read
    something from it; we read the data and continue. The reason why the `main` Go
    routine could not be exited is because we didn't send any value to it before,
    and this is much more effective than using a timer, as we did in our previous
    example.

    that we have two Go routines. The first Go routine performs some actions on the
    data and hands the data to another Go routine, which performs the second processing
    stage on that data. Now, we need a way to pass data between the first Go routine
    and the second one. As you can see, we may need some synchronization between the
    two Go routines because the second Go routine will have to wait until the second
    Go routine provides some data to it.

- en: If you look at the code, you can see that we have used a channel again: `nameChannel`.
    Since we need to access `nameChannel` from the two Go routines, we have to declare
    it within the `main` function. In the first Go routine, we are going to pass some
    data to `nameChannel`, which is `name`. The `name` variable is the string array
    that has some data and comes from the first Go routine. In the second Go routine,
    we are going to use `nameChannel` and we are going to read it as it is filled.
    Moreover, we will have to use another Go routine just to signal to the main Go
    routine to indicate that all the Go routines are finished (`done := make(chan
    string)`). We also have to terminate the application to avoid any deadlocks, using
    the `close` function. When the channel is closed, the `for` loop will be terminated,
    and the Go routine will send some data into the `done` variable. Then, our main
    Go routine will read it and proceed to the next line, exit out of the `main` function,
    and our application will be done. This was the unbuffered channel; that is, you
    can send single data that has to be read and emptied before you send more data
    to it, otherwise it will be blocked.

    while we send data to the name channel, we also read data from it. The following

    read it instead into our `result` variable. The `select` statement will will not
    use both case here; so, for instance, if `channel1` and `channel2` are ready at

    for them in an infinite loop. If you want to get out of this loop, you can read
    another channel, such as `quit`. If `quit` is already present, then you can just
    break out of this loop or if it's a function, you can use return and that will
