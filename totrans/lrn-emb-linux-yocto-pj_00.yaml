- en: With regard to the Linux environment today, most of the topics explained in
    this book are already available and are covered in a fair bit of detail, This
    book also covers a large variety of information and help in creating many viewpoints.
    Of course, there are some very good books written on various subjects also presented
    in this book, and here, you will find references to them. The scope of this book,
    however, is not to present this information all over again, but instead to make
    a parallel between the traditional methods of interaction with the embedded development
    process and the methods used by the Yocto Project.

- en: This book also presents the various challenges that you might encounter in embedded
    Linux and suggests solutions for them. Although this book is intended for developers
    who are pretty confident of their basic Yocto and Linux skills and are trying
    to improve them, I am confident that that those of you who have no real experience
    in this area, could also find some useful information here.

    in your embedded Linux journey. Besides this, technical information and a number
    of exercises are also given to you to ensure that as much information as possible
    is passed on to you. At the end of this book, you should have a clear picture
    of the Linux ecosystem.

- en: Before reading this book, prior knowledge of embedded Linux and Yocto would
    be helpful, though not mandatory. In this book, a number of exercises are available,
    and to do them, a basic understanding of the GNU/Linux environment would be useful.
    Also, some of the exercises are for a specific development board and others involve
    using Qemu. Owning such a board and previous knowledge of Qemu is a plus, but
    is not mandatory.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Throughout the book, there are chapters with various exercises that require
    you to already have knowledge of C language, Python, and Shell Script. It would
    be useful if the reader has experience in these areas, because they are the core
    technologies used in most Linux projects available today. I hope this information
    does not discourage you while reading the content of this book content, and that
    you enjoy it.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The book is targeted at Yocto and Linux enthusiasts who want to build embedded
    Linux systems and maybe contribute to the community. Background knowledge should
    include C programming skills, experience with Linux as a development platform,
    basic understanding of the software development process. If you've previously
    read *Embedded Linux Development with Yocto Project*, *Packt Publishing*, it would
    be a plus as well.

- en: Taking a look at technology trends, Linux is the next big thing. It offers access
    to cutting-edge open source products and more embedded systems are introduced
    to mankind every day. The Yocto Project is the best choice for any project that
    involves interaction with embedded devices due to the fact that it provides a
    rich set of tools to help you to use most of your energy and resources in your
    product development, instead of reinventing.
