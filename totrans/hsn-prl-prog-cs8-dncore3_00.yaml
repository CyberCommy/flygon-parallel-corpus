- en: Packt first contacted me about writing this book nearly a year ago. It's been
    a long journey, harder than I anticipated at times, and I've learned a lot. The
    book you hold now is the culmination of many long days, and I'm proud to finally
    present it.

- en: Having written this book about C# means a lot to me as it has always been a
    dream of mine to write about the language that I started my career with. C# has
    really grown in leaps and bounds since it was first introduced. .NET Core has
    actually enhanced the power and reputation of C# within the developer community.

- en: To make this book meaningful to a wide audience, we will cover both the classic
    threading model and the **Task Parallel Library** (**TPL**), using code to explain
    them. We'll first look at the basic concepts of the OS that make it possible to
    write multithreaded code. We'll then look closely at the differences between classic
    threading and the TPL.

- en: In this book, I take care to approach parallel programming in the context of
    modern-day best programming practices. The examples have been kept short and simple
    so as to ease your understanding. The chapters have been written in a way that
    makes the topics easy to learn even if you don't have much prior knowledge of
    them.
