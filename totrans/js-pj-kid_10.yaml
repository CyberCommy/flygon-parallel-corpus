    You learned how to play with console; solve problems with JavaScript, HTML tags,
    CSS properties, and control statement; use jQuery; draw with canvas; build projects;
    and so on. However, have you ever thought about the opportunities that you got
    by reading the book and learning JavaScript?

- en: If you enjoy programming and want to build your career with programming, JavaScript
    is one of the best languages for this. I can say it would be difficult to make
    better choice than JavaScript. If you look at some of the trends in web development,
    you will see that real-time websites are like desktop applications. Heavy user
    interactions on websites such as dragging and dropping, audio and video interactions,
    and visualization of data are common nowadays. All of these are mostly done using
    JavaScript. Without JavaScript, we would not get the cool web applications (Google
    Map, Google Earth, Gmail, Facebook, and so on). JavaScript has made everything
    possible. No other language is as strong as JavaScript when you want to build
    web applications. The present world is web-based and web is powered by JavaScript
    in order to make it beautiful, dynamic, and secure. Therefore, choosing JavaScript
    with HTML and CSS as your future profession will be one of the best decisions
    in your life. The developers are known as frontend or full-stack developers.

    apps for your smartphones with JavaScript. There are different types of platforms
    for smartphones (for example, Android, iOS, Tizen, Firefox OS, and so on). Every
    platform has its own APIs and uses different programming languages. Therefore,
    we need to consider that our code base may run on any device. To make sure about
    this, we can use the JavaScript engine as it runs on any platform. You can use
    **Cordova** ([http://cordova.apache.org/](http://cordova.apache.org/)) to understand
    how to build apps using JavaScript. Cordova is a JavaScript framework based on
    every device's APIs. You can use **PhoneGap** ([http://phonegap.com/](http://phonegap.com/))
    or **Meteor** ([https://www.meteor.com/](https://www.meteor.com/)) to build smartphone
    apps with JavaScript.

    You may have basic knowledge of JavaScript, which is needed to perform the tasks
    in a web server. Building a web server with other framework may have a high cost;
    however, with JavaScript, you can do it for free, You don't even need to buy any
    software for this.
