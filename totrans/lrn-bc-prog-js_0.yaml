- en: With the help of this book, you'll get to build your own blockchain prototype
    and a decentralized network by using the JavaScript programming language. Building
    your own blockchain will help you understand various concepts related to blockchains,
    such as how blockchain technology works under the hood, how decentralized blockchain
    networks function, and how to code the blockchain and decentralized network using
    JavaScript. Also, you will get to learn why blockchain is such a secure and valuable
    technology.

- en: The blockchain that you'll build throughout this book will have functionalities
    that are similar to those you would find on a real-life blockchain, such as Bitcoin
    or Ethereum. Your blockchain will have functionalities such as the ability to
    mine new blocks, create new and immutable transactions, and perform a proof of
    work to secure the blockchain. In addition to these, your blockchain will consist
    of many other important features. You'll get to explore those as you read further
    through the chapters.

    how blockchain technology actually works and why this technology is so secure
    and valuable. You will also have a deep understanding of how decentralized blockchain
    networks function and why decentralization is such an important feature for securing
    the blockchain.

    what a blockchain actually is and enables readers to understand how it functions.
    Then, you''ll get to learn how to set up a project in order to create your very

    how to add various functionalities to your blockchain. You will implement the
    functionalities in the blockchain, creating some amazing methods such as `createNewBlock`,
    `creatNewTransaction`, and `getLastBlock`. Once these methods are added to the
    blockchain, you will test them to verify that they are working perfectly. Also,
    you''ll get to learn about the hashing method, that is, SHA256 hashing, and then
    implement a method to generate a hash for your block data. Also, you''ll get to
    explore what a proof of work is, how it benefits the blockchain, and how to implement
    it.'

    through an API*, explains how to set up Express.js in your project, as well as
    how to use it to build the API/server. Then, you will build various server endpoints
    for your blockchain and test these endpoints to verify whether or not they are
    working properly.'

    Blockchain Network*, covers how to set up a decentralized network for your blockchain. In
    this chapter, you will get to learn a lot of new concepts related to how to set
    up various nodes and interconnect them to form a network. You''ll also define
    various endpoints, such as `/register-and-broadcast-node`, `/register-node`, and
    `/register-nodes-bulk`. These endpoints will assist you in implementing the decentralized
    blockchain network.'

    so as to have the same transaction data and blocks on all the nodes in the blockchain.
    You''ll implement network synchronization by refactoring the endpoints to broadcast
    the data to all the nodes present in the network.'
