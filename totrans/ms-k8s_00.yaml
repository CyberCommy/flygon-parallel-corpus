    and management of containerized applications. If you are running more than just
    a few containers or want to automate the management of your containers, you need
    Kubernetes. This book focuses on guiding you through the advanced management of
    Kubernetes clusters.

- en: The book begins by explaining the fundamentals behind Kubernetes' architecture
    and covers Kubernetes' design in detail. You will discover how to run complex
    stateful microservices on Kubernetes, including such advanced features as horizontal
    pod autoscaling, rolling updates, resource quotas, and persistent storage backends.
    Using real-world use cases, you will explore the options for network configuration
    and understand how to set up, operate, and troubleshoot various Kubernetes networking
    plugins. Finally, you will learn about custom resource development and utilization
    in automation and maintenance workflows. This book will also cover some additional
    concepts based on Kubernetes 1.10 release, such as Promethus, Role-based access
    control, and API aggregation.
