- en: C++ is an interesting programming language that has been around for almost three
    decades now. It is used to develop complex desktop applications, web applications,
    networking applications, device drivers, kernel modules, embedded applications,
    and GUI applications using third-party widget frameworks; literally speaking,
    C++ can be used in any domain.

- en: Ever since I started programming in 1993, I have cherished the good old technical
    discussions that I had with many of my colleagues and industry experts that I
    met from time to time. Of all the technical discussions, one topic gets repeated
    time and again, which is, *"Do you think C++ is a relevant programming language
    today? Should I continue working on C++ or should I move on to other modern programming
    languages, such as Java, C#, Scala, or Angular/Node.js?"*
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I have always felt that one should be open to learning other technologies, but
    that doesn’t mean having to give up on C++. However, the good news is that with
    the new C++17 features in place, C++ has been reborn and it is going to stay and
    rock for many more decades, which is my motivation to write this book.

- en: People have always felt that Java will take over C++, but it has continued to
    stay. The same discussion started again when C# came into the industry and today
    again when Angular/Node.js and Scala seem to be more attractive for rapid programming.
    However, C++ has its own, place and no programming language has been able to take
    over the place of C++ so far.

- en: There are already many C++ books that help you understand the language, but
    there are very few books that address developing GUI applications in C++, TDD
    with C++, and BDD with C++.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: C++ has come a long way and has now been adopted in several contexts. Its key
    strengths are its software infrastructure and resource-constrained applications.
    The C++ 17 release will change the way developers write code, and this book will
    help you master your developing skills with C++.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With real-world, practical examples explaining each concept, the book will begin
    by introducing you to the latest features of C++ 17\. It will encourage clean
    code practices in C++, and demonstrate GUI app development options in C++. You
    will gain insights into how to avoid memory leaks using smart pointers. Next,
    you will learn how multithreaded programming can help you achieve concurrency
    in your applications.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Moving on, you’ll also get an in-depth understanding of the C++ Standard Template
    Library. We'll explain the concepts of implementing TDD and BDD in your C++ programs,
    along with template-based generic programming, to equip you with the expertise
    to build powerful applications. Finally, we’ll round the book off with debugging
    techniques and best practices. By the time you reach the end of the book, you
    will have an in-depth understanding of the language and its various facets.
