- en: This section will primarily focus on building and deploying Spring Boot applications
    using Skaffold to local (minikube and so on) and remote clusters (**GKE**). We
    will explore how you can build and deploy cloud-native applications from the comfort
    of your IDE using Cloud Code developed by Google. Then we will build and deploy
    a Spring Boot application to a managed Kubernetes offering such as **GKE** using
    Skaffold. We will further learn about creating a production-ready CI/CD pipeline
    using Skaffold and GitHub Actions. We will do some experiments by combining Skaffold
    and Argo CD to implement a GitOps-style CD workflow. Finally, we will look at
    some alternatives to Skaffold and learn about Skaffold best practices that we
    should utilize in our workflow. Furthermore, we will explore the most common pitfalls/limitations
    of developing an application with Skaffold. Finally, we will summarize what we
    have learned throughout this book.
