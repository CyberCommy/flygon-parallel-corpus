- en: So where do we go from here? Over the past six chapters we have taken a quick
    peek into the world of gamification. We started with understanding what gamification
    is. We then looked at the gamification design process. We talked about Game Mechanics
    and even defined fun as best we could.

- en: We find that gamification is really a "mash up" or a mixture of disciplines
    cobbled together to meet a business objective. When taking on a gamification project,
    you are dabbling in everything from motivation theory, to game theory, to design
    and psychology. Hence, you can take your gamification further so there are a myriad
    of things we could delve into.

    a better understanding of the many different behavior models such as the **Fogg
    Behavior** model, **Bartle's Player** model, or the **PENS** model. Researchers
    have only scratched the surface of understanding the behavior of people in a gaming
    environment.

- en: We can expect to see gamification grow considerably over the next three to four
    years as more businesses need engagement with their customers. That engagement
    must however be pleasurable for customers. People have so many options today when
    it comes to whom they want to buy from .They have so many more options for organizations
    to get involved with. We will only participate in and engage with products and
    services that we enjoy.

    them, and making the purchase of products more enjoyable. That's ultimately what
    Gamification is all about.

- en: We can expect to see gamification applications pop up all around us. Gamification
    will be big not only in education but also in public services, such as government.
    We can expect to see an increase in gamification wherever behavior is important
    for the success or failure of an organization.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: On the other hand, the increase in bad gamification implementations should alarm
    us. As gamification practitioners work out the methodologies, we can expect some
    mistakes. It will take time for us to grasp the understanding that gamification
    is more than points, leaderboards, and badges. It is about pleasurable engagement
    and experience for our users.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Over the long term, we can expect gamification to mature and ultimately become
    ubiquitous. We will simply come to expect challenge, joy, pleasure, and social
    interaction from any organization or product that we engage in.

- en: In our e-learning application we wrote a lot of code. We wrote code either in
    our database in MySQL, in PHP, on the client side, or in JavaScript specifically,
    or in particular, we worked with jQuery wherever possible, which is just a library
    of JavaScript functions that helps us to do things but there are some things that
    we could have done to spruce up, or to make the application a lot cleaner and
    a lot nicer. We could have found a lot of that functionality for free in the jQuery
    plugins.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: An important factor that we might want to take a look at is a plugin that helps
    us build dialog boxes, for example (`Alertify.js`), which is freely available
    on the Web. We might also possibly consider working with `icheck.js`, which is
    a jQuery plugin that enhances form controls. It is completely customizable and
    even works in a mobile environment. We are able to make our buttons and our checkboxes
    a lot nicer-looking.

- en: We could have possibly also used one `jqueryfileupload` object, which is a jQuery
    widget plugin that allows for drag-and-drop and multiple-file upload.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One jQuery that I think we possibly could have used, especially in our account
    creation module, is `complexify.js`, which determines or assesses the complexity
    of a user's password. You can use it on forms and objects of that nature. It allows
    you to present a percentage to the users. So you can force users to create passwords
    with a specified level of complexity, making them more secure.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Plugins are freely available on the Internet and they are pretty easy to use.
    Therefore, we can take advantage of the code that other developers have written
    to make our applications cleaner, nicer-looking, and easier to use.

- en: When it comes to gamification plugins, several companies are making gamification
    APIs and SDKs available. However, they are usually not free. You can gamify many
    aspects of your website with a variety of Plug and Play modules that simply plug
    in to your website. This allows you to quickly implement some basic game mechanics
    into your web applications. Gigya offers a leaderboard plugin that highlights
    top performers. You can configure it to filter by time period and achievement
    type.
  prefs: []

    social rank. It provides a complete overview of where a user stands in your gamified
    environment.

    badges. Their notification plugin alerts users when they unlock new achievements
    and badges.
  prefs: []

- en: Probably their most exciting plugin is the **Activity Feed** plugin. It displays
    real-time user activity on a page, almost like Facebook. This leverages the whole
    social connection. It allows users to get real-time competitive updates from both
    their social network of friends and other players.

- en: Another company that offers a suite of tools and plugins for gamification environments
    is Badgeville. They offer widget studio and developer tools that give us a library
    of JavaScript widgets. They work a lot like jQuery plugins that interact with
    the Badgeville API. They are JavaScript-based and work like any other RESTful
    API, making them relatively easy to implement. The widget studio allows you to
    add different widgets and gamification mechanics into a website with very little
    coding on your part.
  prefs: []

- en: Badgeville focuses on behavior mechanics. Hence many of their plugins are for
    user engagement with customers and employees. Their platform goes deeper than
    points, badges, and leaderboards. Their suite uses reputation mechanics and social
    mechanics to influence behavior. They provide a toolset allowing you to reward
    users, elevate their status, give them a sense of accomplishment, and deliver
    an overall social experience.
