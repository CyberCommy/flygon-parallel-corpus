- en: In this section, we will cover more advanced MongoDB operations. We will start
    with CRUD operations, which are the most commonly used operations. Then, we will
    move on to more advanced querying concepts, followed by multi-document ACID transactions,
    which were introduced in version 4.0\. The next topic to be covered is the aggregation
    framework, which can help users process big data in a structured and efficient
    way. Finally, we will learn how to index our data such that reads are way faster,
    but without impacting write performance.
