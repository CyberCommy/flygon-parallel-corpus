- en: Frameworks and libraries come and go. Design patterns usually stay for longer.
    In this book, we do a mix of learning React Native and design patterns relevant
    to this ecosystem. When it comes to React, the essential knowledge about design
    patterns is spread all over the place. Sometimes it's buried in proprietary code
    bases. This book brings it to you. I call them **idea patterns:** hands-on design
    patterns that are explained with real working examples. In this book we use React
    Native, but you can successfully use most of those patterns in web development
    with React, or even other frameworks, such as Angular or Vue. Hopefully you will
    use this knowledge to build well thought-out and easy-to-maintain code bases.
    Good luck with this endeavor!

- en: Amateur programmers and passionate people are very welcome to read this book,
    but expect that it may be more challenging than elementary programming books.

- en: I assume you have some programming experience in JavaScript and that the terminal
    window is not foreign to you. Ideally, you should work as a developer (junior/mid/senior)
    so you will have a broad perspective and can immediately apply the knowledge to
    your work. Experience in developing mobile applications is not required.

- en: Play with the examples I have prepared. Each is a standalone application so
    you can play and improve the code as we go. This is meant to serve as a playground
    so you can not only learn from the examples but create extensions of them. As
    you build, you will understand the changes that are introduced section after section.
    If you just read the book, you will definitely miss this perspective.
