- en: In an age when the term **application developer** nearly always implies **web
    application developer**, the building of desktop GUI applications may seem in
    danger of becoming a quaint and obscure art. Yet on every forum, mailing list,
    and chat service where programming is discussed, I find young Python coders eager
    to dive into GUI toolkits so that they can start building the kind of software
    that any average person can readily identify as an application. The one GUI library
    consistently recommended to these learners, the one that is arguably Python's
    most exciting and most complete toolkit, is PyQt.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Despite this popularity, there have been relatively few resources available
    for learning PyQt. Those who wish to learn it must rely heavily on outdated books,
    C++ documentation, scattered blogs, or snippets of code found in mailing lists
    or Stack Overflow posts. There is an apparent need for a modern tutorial and reference
    on PyQt for the Python programmer, and this book aims to fill that need.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'My first book, *Python GUI Programming with Tkinter,* focused on the rudiments
    of application development using Tkinter, covering core topics such as interface
    design, unit testing, program architecture, and packaging. In this book, I wanted
    to go beyond the basics, not just teaching you how to build data-driven business
    forms (which so many toolkits can produce, and so many other books can teach you
    to write), but to explore the more exciting and unique possibilities offered by
    PyQt: multimedia, animation, 3D graphics, image manipulation, networking, multi-threading,
    and more. Of course, this book doesn''t shirk the business side of things either,
    with solid coverage of data entry forms, SQL databases, and charting.'

- en: There are two kinds of authors who write technical books. The first is the absolute
    expert, with infallible authority and encyclopedic knowledge of the topic at hand,
    who is able to draw on a deep understanding to produce explanations that perfectly
    address the learner's most pertinent needs.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The second kind of author is a mere mortal possessed of a reasonable familiarity
    with the basics, a willingness to research what is not known, and most importantly,
    a dogged determination to ensure that every statement asserted in print is the
    whole and correct truth. This author must be prepared to stop mid-sentence in
    the flow of writing to test claims in the interpreter or code editor; to spend
    hours reading documentation, mailing-list threads, code comments, and IRC logs
    in the pursuit of a more correct understanding; and to delete and rewrite large
    swathes of their work when a new fact reveals a fault in their original assumptions.

- en: When I was asked to write a book on PyQt5, I could make no claims to being the
    first sort of author (nor can I now); while I had developed and maintained several
    PyQt applications both at work and in the open source world, my understanding
    of PyQt rarely strayed beyond the simple needs of my own code. So, I have aspired
    to be the second type, committing myself to diligent study and the painstaking
    process of sifting and distilling the tangled mass of available information into
    a text that might guide the aspiring GUI programmer toward mastery of PyQt.

- en: As a proud father of five children, some of whom have a budding (if not blooming)
    interest in programming, I have worked these past six months to write a book that
    I could confidently and conscientiously put before them, should they wish to learn
    these skills. I hope, dear reader, that you sense in this text this parental enthusiasm
    for your growth and progress as we tackle this subject together.

    the PyQt application framework and learn how to make powerful GUI applications.
    It is assumed that the reader knows the basics of Python syntax, features, and
    idioms such as functions, classes, and common standard library tools. It is also
    assumed the reader has an environment in which they are comfortable writing and
    executing Python code.
