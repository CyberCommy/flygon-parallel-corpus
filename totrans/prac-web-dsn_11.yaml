- en: Bootstrap is an open source HTML, CSS, and JS library that helps you build websites
    and apps very easily. It is a library of components that you can reuse instead
    of re-creating every component over and over again. Bootstrap is responsive and
    mobile first; this is essentially what Bootstrap is all about, and why it has
    become so popular with web developers. Now, let's say the developers are creating
    different versions of their website for different devices; just by applying small
    amounts of code to the pages, the sites will be displayed correctly on any device,
    which saves time and additional cost.

    in 2012, then was reasonably quickly replaced with Bootstrap 3, which was released
    in 2013\. Then, of course, there came Bootstrap 4 in 2016\. The more stable it
    becomes, the longer the gaps between the releases. Hopefully, it won't be too
    long before Bootstrap 5 arrives.

    on to describe the different elements of the Navbar, including adding your brand,
    the different color schemes, and how to make your Navbar responsive. There is

    grid system; it will all become clear as you work your way through the chapter
    and get hands-on experience. To give the best example of what the grid system

- en: There are five tiers of predefined classes for building complex responsive layouts.
    In this example, we can see that the new `col` class is being used. This means
    that in this row, we have essentially four columns along the same row, and each
    element is taking up a specific number of columns along the 12 column row.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the first case, each element is taking up three columns along the 12 column
    row, as three goes into 12 four times. This layout will also be the same on all
    devices, from extra small all the way up to extra large. You can also define the
    number of columns you want to take up along the row if you wanted, which is in
    this example in the second row.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'So, the first bit of content will take up `8` columns, and the next will take
    up `4`. Again, that will fill the entire 12 columns along the row, no matter what
    the screen size is. Bootstrap is so popular because of its responsive nature and
    the fact that certain elements are stacked on the smaller devices and they are
    aligned along the row on the larger devices. To do that, we simply need to define
    the device size within our column class:'

    class, the content is similar, as we have `8` and `4` on the top, then the next
    row is switched into three sections. However, on the live example of both the
    content would actually stack on the smaller devices, and when the breakpoint hits
    anything above the smaller devices, it will display along the row. There is a
    lot more information on the Grid system within this page, however, as I mentioned,
    you'll soon get used to how it works as we work our way through the chapter.
