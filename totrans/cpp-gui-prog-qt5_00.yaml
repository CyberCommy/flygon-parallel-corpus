  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Qt comes with a set of tools that make programmers'' lives easier. One of the
    tools is Qt Creator (seen in the following screenshot), which is an **IDE** (**integrated
    development environment**) that consists of a code editor and a **GUI** (**graphical
    user interface**) designer that works hand-in-hand with other Qt tools, such as
    the compiler, debugger, and so on. The most attractive tool among all is, of course,
    the GUI designer, which comes with two different types of editors: one for widget-based
    applications, called Qt Designer, and another for Qt Quick Application, called
    Qt Quick Designer. Both tools can be accessed directly in Qt Creator when you
    open up a relevant file format. Qt Creator also includes a built-in documentation
    viewer called Qt Assistant. It is really handy since you can look for the explanation
    about a certain Qt class or function by simply hovering the mouse cursor over
    the class name in your source code, and pressing the *F1* key. Qt Assistant will
    then be opened and show you the documentation related to the Qt class or function:'
