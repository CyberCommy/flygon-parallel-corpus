    how goroutines work, how to use them in a concurrent fashion, and some of the
    common mistakes that might occur. They were simple to use and reason about, but
    they were limited because they are able to spawn other goroutines and wait on
    system calls. In reality, goroutines are more capable than what was shown in the
    previous chapter, and to uncover their full potential we need to understand how
    to use channels, which is the aim of the current chapter. Here, we will look at

    in a simultaneous fashion. However, there is an inherent risk involved when the
    said goroutines need to work on a common source that has a lower limit on the
    number of simultaneous tasks it can handle. This might cause the common source
    to significantly slow down or in some cases even fail. As you might guess, this
    is not a new problem in the field of computer science, and there are many ways
    to handle it. As we shall see throughout the chapter, Go provides mechanisms to
    control parallelism in a simple and intuitive fashion. Let's start by looking
    at an example to simulate the problem of burdened common source, and then proceed
    to solve it.

    `recv1` or `recv2` starts listening on the channel to receive the message. If
    we assume that `recv2` receives the message sent on the channel by `send100`,
    then `recv1` will be waiting until another message is sent on the channel. If

    the goroutines receiving the messages can handle them. If we use unbuffered channels,
    it would significantly slow down the program because we will have to wait for
    each message to be processed before we can put in another message. It would be
    ideal if the channel could store these extra messages or "buffer" the messages.
    This is exactly what a buffered channel does. It maintains a queue of messages
    which a goroutine will consume at its own pace. However, even a buffered channel

    this with the help of unidirectional channels. Once a channel has been identified

- en: In later chapters, from [Chapter 5](../Text/Ch05.xhtml), *Introducing Goophr*,
    through to [Chapter 8](../Text/Ch08.xhtml), *Deploying Goophr*, we will be developing
    a distributed web application. This requires us to have basic knowledge of how
    to interact with a web server, using the HTTP protocol using tools other than
    a web browser. This knowledge will come in handy not only when interacting with
    our application but also with the standard web as a developer. This will be the
    subject of the next chapter, [Chapter 4](../Text/Ch04.xhtml), *The RESTful Web*,
    where we will look at the tools and protocols we will be using to interact with
    our web application.
