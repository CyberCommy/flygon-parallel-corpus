- en: In today's world, new threats, breaches, and malicious activities are discovered
    and published in the news, websites, and portals quite regularly. As much as we
    try to secure our data, systems, and networks to the best of our abilities, breaches
    occur. In an effort to understand what took place, we turn to the field of digital
    forensics. Although still a relatively new field, forensics has become just as
    important as security, especially when considering the wealth of information available
    to anyone accessing the internet with the intent of carrying out malicious activity.
    Thankfully, digital fingerprints and artifacts are sometimes left behind, whether
    in a deleted or hidden file, email, in someone's browsing history, remote connection
    list, or even mobile text message.
