- en: Since the 1975 movie *Jaws*, whenever we get in the water, we all have this
    instinctive apprehension about what swims beneath. Sharks are unparalleled killing
    machines. They have a better detection system than the most technologically advanced
    sonar. They swim faster than speed boats. They have three rows of razor-sharp
    teeth that continuously regrow. Yet, did you know that deep in the comfort of
    your home, somewhere in the dark, there is something a thousand times deadlier
    than any great white? There are, on average, 80 shark attacks every year, mostly
    exploratory bites and mistaken identity. Meanwhile, falling out of bed carries
    a far greater probability. Sharks are majestic creatures. If they wanted us dead,
    we would be. Apparently, they don't like junk food.

    gladly sharpen pitchforks at the single mention of your profession. In this chapter,
    we will debunk 10 of the most enduring myths surrounding short selling:'

    encouraged market participants to buy stocks to "shore up the market." They claimed
    it was "the patriotic thing to do." I grew up in an era when patriots were altruistic
    individuals who put their lives at risk so that others may have a better future.
    Somewhere along Wall Street, a patriot became someone who put other people's money
    at risk in order to guarantee an end-of-year bonus and ego massage.

    nor were they responsible for its collapse. Their crime was to do their homework,
    take the other side, and profit from the debacle.'

    versus passive investing debate. Active management refers to fund managers taking
    bets away from the benchmark, a practice referred to as active money. Passive
    investing refers to minimizing the tracking error by mimicking the index. Active
    managers claim their stock-picking ability and portfolio management skills deliver
    superior returns. However, the numbers tell a different story. According to S&P's
    *Index versus Active* reports, the vast majority of active managers underperform
    the S&P 500 benchmark on 1, 3, and 5 year-horizons. This means that their cumulative
    compounded returns are lower than the benchmark. **Exchange-Traded Funds**, or
    **ETFs**, fared better than active managers every year on record, even during
    the most severe market downturns.

    active managers to prove that they can deliver more than the index. The debate
    has gradually shifted from "which manager should we allocate to?" to "remind me
    again why we should be going with an expensive underperforming benchmark hugger
    when there is a liquid, better, cheaper alternative?"

    is severe. If managers deviate and outperform, they are knighted as "stock pickers."
    Yet, when they stray and underperform, they are dubbed as having "high tracking
    errors." This often leads to redemptions, the kiss of death for fund managers.
    When the choice is between becoming a hero or keeping your job, self-preservation
    compels active managers to mirror the benchmark, a practice referred to as **closet
    indexing**. This is the famous "*no-one ever got fired for holding [insert big
    safe blue-chip stock here…]*" line. If active managers end up mirroring their
    benchmark, then the "active versus passive" debate is a misnomer. It really comes
    down to a choice between low-cost indexing via an index fund versus expensive
    closet indexing via a self-preserving active manager. Either way, you get the
    same index, but with the latter, you also have to pay a middle-man, called an
    active manager. As John Boggle, founder of Vanguard, used to say: "*in investing,
    you get what you don''t pay for*."'

    are exceptional active managers worth every penny of their management fees. It
    simply means that the average active mutual fund manager gives active management
    a bad name. Investors who go down the active management route not only take an
    equity risk premium. They also take an active management risk premium. The current
    crisis of active management is nothing but the time-honored routine of the middle
    man in every industry who realizes that they can no longer delay efficiency.

    make them bigger, hyper-leverage, and put the same people responsible for the
    GFC back in the driver''s seat, rest assured that markets are bound to hit "soft
    patches" again. Long-only active managers may display heroic grace under fire
    during bear markets but, when your net worth has gone down by 50%, a 1 or 2% outperformance
    is a rounding error. Two double diamond black slopes in a decade and everyone

    have to stay invested with them during bull markets. More than any other market
    participants, they understand the cyclicality of inflows and redemptions. If you

    numbers instead of stories, then passive investing is the way to go on the long
    side. For capital protection and alpha generation during downturns, investors

    relevant.

    Warren Buffett turned an ailing textile company named Berkshire Hathaway into
    an industrial conglomerate. Jeff Bezos built Amazon. Steve Jobs 2.0 was the architect
    of Apple's renaissance. If top management is so eager to take credit for success,
    then it should equally be held responsible for failure. Steve Jobs 1.0 ran Apple
    into the ground. Kay Whitmore buried Kodak. The responsibility for Bears Stearns,
    Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch, and AIG falls squarely on the shoulders of those
    at the helm. Short sellers did not make any of the bad decisions that destroyed
    those companies. Bad management makes bad decisions that lead to bad outcomes,

    to a cognitive bias called the Dunning-Kruger effect. As an example, Kodak was
    once an iconic brand. Management believed they were so ahead of the game they
    could indefinitely delay innovation. They took a step backward to their old core
    technology when the world was moving forward. As tragic as it was back then, there
    is no flower on Kodak's grave today. The world, and even the 50,000 Kodak employees

    hundreds of car manufacturers between the two world wars emerged a few winners.
    The rest of the industry went out of business. For every winner, there are countless
    losers. Today, everyone is perfectly happy with horse-carts running around Central

    or been merged into larger companies. Radio Shack did not go out of business because

    bad breath, colorful language, and small positions relative to the overall float,
    then faith in capitalism should join the great white shark and polar bear in the
    list of endangered species. The national sport of short sellers is to unveil paradoxes
    in the fabric of the corporate space-time continuum. Ignorance and competence
    cannot exist in the same place at the same time. Basically, you cannot pretend
    to know what you are doing if you don't know what is going on. Strangely enough,
    this is a lie embattled CEOs would like us to believe. Whenever they are questioned
    about the illicit activities of their subordinates, their first line of defense
    is to feign indignation and throw them under the Bentley, pretending that they
    were unaware of the illicit actions perpetrated by a few isolated rogue individuals.

    cover-up, or they really do not know what is going on and therefore incompetent.
    Either way, they are unfit for duty and undeserving of their compensation packages.
    That explains why, whenever short sellers uncover malfeasance, top management
    goes on the offensive and portrays short sellers as evil speculators who spread

    be careful about their facts and wording. Secondly, regulators do not take kindly
    to short sellers shorting across pension funds' large holdings. They are audited
    on a regular basis. Compliance is a survival mechanism. If your business model
    is to manipulate share price by spreading rumors and trade on it, then drop this

    fragile segment of the industry. On the one hand, short sellers want recognition
    for the value they bring to the markets. In the words of James Surowiecki, they
    balance out "Wall Street's inherent bullish bias," and play "a vital role in uncovering
    malfeasance." Short sellers also want to be treated fairly, just like any other
    market participant.

    Airing commercials or sponsoring documentaries to expose companies as frauds and
     their management as crooks is a double-edged sword. Every successful campaign
    builds up resentment amidst corporations, regulators, and the public. Every short-term
    pyrrhic skirmish won makes the long-term victory ever more elusive. Many jurisdictions
    still ban short selling. Those that allow short selling have cumbersome administrative
    rules such as the uptick rule, an obligation to secure "borrow" before trading.
    The uptick rule stipulates that a short sale can only take place following an
    uptick in traded price.

    Please be kind to top management. Do not remind them of their obsolescence. Time
    and markets are cruel enough already. The middle ground is simply to say you are
    shorting underperformers relative to the benchmark. Looking for relative shorts
    does not infuriate corporations, quite the opposite in fact. Every start up entrepreneur
    in Silicon Valley knows that markets have only two seasons, bull and bear. A bull
    market is series A and IPO season. A bear market is "go back working for the man"
    season. Executives in defensive sectors, such as food or utilities, do not expect
    their stocks to be assets of choice during bull markets. In fact, they would probably
    rescind their pension mandate to a manager who would gulp up their stock in a
    bull market, unless of course you are Warren Buffett and you talk to Coca-Cola.

    demand a moratorium on short selling. In response, the U.S. **Securities and Exchange
    Commission** (**SEC**) put a temporary ban on short selling in the country in
    an effort to "restore equilibrium to the markets." This was lifted a short time
