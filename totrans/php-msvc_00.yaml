- en: Microservices are the new kids on the block. They are a way of solving problems,
    but it does not mean that they will always be the best solution. Microservices
    are a full and complex architecture that you need to understand deeply in order
    to be able to apply them successfully in the real world.

- en: We know that understanding and having everything in place for microservices
    can take time and can be very complex, so for this reason we wrote this book--to
    give you a small guide to microservices, from A to Z. This book will only be a
    glimpse of what you can do with microservices, but we hope that it will be at
    least a helpful start into this world.

- en: We will start our journey in this book by explaining the foundations of this
    architecture, the basic knowledge you will need to have. As you advance through the
    book, we will be increasing the level of difficulty. However, we will guide you
    through every step of the process, so at the end of the book you will be able
    to know whether a microservice architecture is the best solution for your problem
    and how can you apply this architecture.
