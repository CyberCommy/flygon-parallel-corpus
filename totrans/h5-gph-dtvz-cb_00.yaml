- en: Today, the Web and the world are increasingly being defined by data. With the
    data revolution of the Internet in the early nineties and until today, more and
    more data has been exposed and aggregated, from government agencies, public sector
    information, financial information, digital media and news, and social media to
    private sector information, user information, and so on. With the overload of
    data on the Web it's easy to overlook information, as it's much harder to read
    and analyze in data format. That's where we come in. Our goal in this book is
    to open up the door to you to data visualization. With step-by-step guides that
    will take you from the basic creation of visual charts all the way through to
    complex geographical location information driven by Google Maps and Google Docs
    (Drive).

- en: HTML5 and JavaScript are leading the new paths for data visualization and are
    moving us away from traditional client-side graph creation in Adobe Flash or server-side
    generated images. With the maturing of browsers, they are becoming more capable
    and solid than ever before. This is a perfect time to start transitioning the
    creation of graphs to HTML/JavaScript. But where do you start, and what is the
    best way to create the specific graph/map your project needs?

- en: With that said, our goal in this book is to run through, showcase, and teach
    all the critical skills needed in the HTML5/JavaScript age of data visualization.
    Our goal is to help you make the right choice when you need to build a custom
    graphic or graph/chart and to help you choose the right way between creating it
    on your own or using third-party, small/large tools to create the graphic your
    task needs.

- en: Although this is a cookbook, I've painstakingly organized it topic by topic
    in a very linear way, making it a great read from start to end. As such, I personally
    recommend that you sit back and actually read it from start to finish, and if
    you do so, you will learn in the process everything you ever needed to know about
    the two-dimensional Canvas API, how to create shapes, interaction, and various
    graphs/charts, and how to create them from scratch in HTML5 Canvas. You will learn
    how to work with and modify third-party tools, working with the Google Visualization
    API, Google Maps, and Google Docs. Woven throughout the book are various data
    formats from basic strings, external files, XML, and Google Docs to Twitter search
    results. As such, you will get an extra practice in loading, modifying, and working
    with data in JavaScript.

- en: '[Chapter 1](ch01.html "Chapter 1. Drawing Shapes in Canvas"), *Drawing Shapes
    in Canvas*, introduces you to working with canvas. We will spend the majority
    of our time working with canvas when creating our charts. In this chapter, we
    will focus on getting to know how canvas works and how to create custom shapes
    with the two-dimensional canvas API.'

    in Canvas*, continues where we left off in [Chapter 1](ch01.html "Chapter 1. Drawing
    Shapes in Canvas") as we master our skills in canvas by adding to our tool belt
    various functions. We will be working with curves, images, text, and even pixel
    manipulation.'

    Cartesian-based Graphs*, presents our first cluster of charts under the microscope,
    Cartesian-based graphs. Altogether this graph style is relatively simple; it opens
    the door to amazingly creative ways of exploring data. In this chapter, we will
    lay down the foundations to building charts, and with them, will continue and
    expand our overall canvas knowledge.'

    Up*, leverages the capability of creating non-linear charts to represent multidimensional
    data. In this chapter we will create Bubble, Pie, Doughnut, Radar, and Tree charts.'

- en: '[Chapter 5](ch05.html "Chapter 5. Getting Out of the Box"), *Getting Out of
    the Box*, progresses into more out-of-the-box, less commonly used charts and revisits
    some of our old charts to incorporate into them dynamic data or change their layout.
    In this chapter, we will create a funnel chart, add interactivity to our charts,
    create a recursive tree chart, add user interaction, and finish up with creating
    an interactive click meter.'

    Static Things to Life*, introduces JavaScript object-oriented programming, creating
    from scratch an animation library, adding multiple layers of canvas, and finishing
    up with creating a legend that is aware of its surrounding. This chapter will
    break us into a few new habits by first making everything dynamic followed by
    creating a more object-oriented program so it''s easier for us to differentiate
    between tasks and reduce our code footprint.'

- en: '[Chapter 7](ch07.html "Chapter 7. Depending on the Open Source Sphere"), *Depending
    on the Open Source Sphere*, introduces you to the various libraries. The open
    source data visualization community is extremely rich and detailed with so many
    options and some really amazing libraries. Each library has its strong points
    and its disadvantages. Some are standalone code, while others depend on other
    platforms. Our goal in this chapter is both to showcase what we think are the
    best, most creative options online, and with it, to also learn the new skill of
    customizing third-party tools and expanding their features beyond their available
    documentation.'

    Google Charts*, explores the Google visualization API, task by task. We will look
    at the steps involved to create a chart and integrate it with the charting API.
    In the process, we will create new graphs and explore the core capabilities of
    this library.'

    explores some of the features available on Google Maps to get us ready to work
    with mapping in general. Mapping on its own isn''t data visualization, but after
    we establish our base understanding of how to work with maps, we will have a very
    stable background that will enable us to create many cutting-edge, cool projects
    integrating data and data visualization.'

    in more deeply to our topic of data visualization and mapping. One of the most
    popular ways to visualize data these days is by using maps. In this chapter, we
    will explore a few ideas on how to integrate data into maps using the Google Maps
    platform.'
