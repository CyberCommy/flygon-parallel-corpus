- en: Businesses today are evolving so rapidly that having their own infrastructure
    to support their expansion is not feasible. As a result, they have been resorting
    to the elasticity of the cloud to provide a platform to build and deploy their
    highly scalable applications.

- en: This book will be the one stop for you to learn all about building cloud-native
    architectures in Python. It will begin by introducing you to cloud-native architecture
    and will help break it down for you. Then you'll learn how to build microservices
    in Python using REST API's in an event-driven approach and you will build the
    web layer. Next, you'll learn about interacting with data services and building
    web views with React, after which we will take a detailed look at application
    security and performance. Then, you'll also learn how to Dockerize your services.
    And finally, you'll learn how to deploy the application on the AWS and Azure platforms.
    We will end the book by discussing some concepts and techniques around troubleshooting
    problems that might occur with your applications after you've deployed them.

    units, using all the proven best practices and avoiding the usual traps. It's
    a practical book; we're going to build everything using Python 3 and its amazing
    tooling ecosystem. The book will take you on a journey, the destination of which
    is the creation of a complete Python application based on microservices over the
    cloud platform.
