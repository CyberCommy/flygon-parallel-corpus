    a Kubernetes playground where you play around until you’re a world authority!

    love Docker Desktop, and I spin up test clusters on Google’s GKE all the time.

    to be! I remember studying for my MSCE in Windows NT, and spending countless hours
    rebuilding NT domains from CD installs every time I trashed my lab. There really
    is no excuse for not getting our hands dirty these days!

    are integral to Kubernetes, so if you need to know Docker, go check it out - it’s
    called Docker Deep Dive, and you can get it on Amazon and Leanpub.

    **Kubernetes Deep Dive** on A Cloud Guru. If you’ve read all the book, you probably
    want to go straight to the deep dive course.

- en: If you’re not a member of Pluralsight or A Cloud Guru, I recommend becoming
    one! Yes, they cost money, but they could be one of the best things you ever do
    for your career! A monthly subscription on each platform gets you access to **every
    course in that platform’s library** - everything from developer to IT ops. And
    if you’re unsure about spending your money, there’s usually a free trial where
    you can get free access for a limited time.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It takes a **ridiculous** amount of time and dedication to write a book. So,
    I’d really appreciate a quick review on Amazon. It’ll take a couple of minutes,
    and you can even post an Amazon review if you bought the book from somewhere else!
    All types of reviews welcome!
