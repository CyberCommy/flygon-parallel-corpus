- en: This isn't actually a book about writing CSS, as in the stuff inside the curly
    braces. It's a book about the organising and architecture of CSS; the parts outside
    the braces. It's the considerations that can be happily ignored on smaller projects
    but actually become the most difficult part of writing CSS in larger projects.

    try and clarify.

    be a few possible metrics that relate to the *large* or *big* part of the description:'

- en: It might be CSS that simply has a large file size. There's a lot of CSS output
    and so making changes to that codebase can be difficult, as there is so much of
    the code to consider.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The CSS could be said to be *large* due to the complexity of the user interface
    that is being built with it. The overall file size may be smaller than the first
    situation but there may be a great many pieces of user interface that's codified
    in those styles. Considering how to effect changes across all of those visuals
    may be problematic.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It might be *large CSS* simply due to the number of developers that have, are,
    and will be likely to touch and change the CSS codebase.

    CSS on large scale web applications.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The definition of what makes something a *web application* as opposed to merely
    a *web page* can be divisive so let's put that aside for now. Let's simply consider
    the scenario in which a new approach to writing CSS was needed.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Consider an interface that was, by necessity, densely populated with visual
    components; sliders, buttons, input fields etc.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In addition, consider that this interface was (and is) constantly evolving and
    needed to be changed rapidly. Furthermore, any changes might be made by any number
    of different style sheet authors.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Without a clearly defined CSS writing methodology, through the many iterations,
    the CSS was always out of hand. The style sheets were in a perpetual state of
    entropy as a result of mixed approaches, different levels of technical understanding
    between authors and code documentation that varied greatly in quality.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So the result was CSS that was difficult to iterate upon, hard to reason about
    and nobody was ever quite sure where redundancy lay. Worse still, style sheet
    authors lacked the confidence to remove code for fear of inadvertently effecting
    other parts of the application.

    some of what I'm describing will sound familiar.

- en: 'Therefore, at the outset of my journey, I defined some basic needs. More simply,
    these were the problems that any new CSS authoring approach had to solve. Here
    is the list of those needs:'

    not unintentionally effect others

  prefs:

    change within the user interface

    many advocates for that.
