    to secure the CentOS system we are using. Security is the most important part
    for a system or server and thus, a System Administrator's job is always to keep
    the system up to date and secure from different kind of attacks that happen on
    a regular basis on servers.

    and user-space tools that have been present in CentOS for quite a long time. It
    is a kind of mechanism that supports Mandatory Access Control security policies,
    which were initially developed by the US National Security Agency and later released
    in the public domain to protect computer systems from malicious intrusion and

    learn about SELinux and just disable it directly. However, a properly configured
    SELinux system can reduce the security risks to a great extent.

- en: 'SELinux implements **Mandatory Access Control** (**MAC**), which works on top
    of already available **Discretionary Access Control** (**DAC**) on CentOS 7\.
    DAC is the traditional security model that we have on Linux systems where we have
    three entities: User, Group, and Others who can have a combination of read, write,
    and execute permission for files and directories. By default, if a user creates
    any file in his home directory, the user and his group will have the read access
    and the user will have write access to the file but the other entity might also
    have read access to it.'

  prefs: []

- en: The user who owns the file can change this access policy and grant or revoke
    access as well as ownership of the file. This might leave critical files exposed
    to accounts that don't need access to these files and thus pose as a security
    threat to the running system. It confines every process to its own domain and
    makes sure that it can interact only with a defined type of files and processes
    and thus protect the system from a hacker hijacking a script or process and gaining
    system-wide control through it.

- en: In this chapter, we looked into various aspects of SELinux and how to configure
    it; we also demonstrated how to use it according to our needs. However, be cautious
    and never test SELinux on a production system. It is better to use a production
    replica and test everything there first. The SELinux facility will enhance the
    security of a system when it's properly configured, but it's best used when strict
    security controls are necessary and only when it is deployed with care.
