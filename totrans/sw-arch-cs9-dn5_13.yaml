    understand how .NET 5 goes in this direction to solve the problem of managing
    and maintaining a reusable library.

    must be aware when this is important for the scenario you are dealing with. Many
    good software architects agree that there is a lot of overengineering due to trying
    to make things reusable even though they are often single-use or not understood

    classes. This will cause a lot of trouble, especially if the same approach is

    how you have to calculate the average or if you just get a bug in the calculation
    formula, you will have to fix it in all instances of code. If you do not remember
    to update it in all places, you will possibly end up with an inconsistent implementation.

- en: The big difference between a team that incentivizes code reuse and one that
    does not is the velocity of delivering good software to end users. Of course,
    beginning this approach is not easy, but rest assured that you will get good results
    after some time working with it.

- en: This chapter aimed to help you understand the advantages of code reuse. It also
    gave you an idea about what is not properly reused code. This chapter also presented
    approaches for reusing and refactoring code.

- en: Considering that technology without processes does not take you anywhere, a
    process was presented that helps enable code reuse. This process is related to
    using already completed components from your library; identifying features in
    the software requirements specification that are candidates to be designed as
    library components; modifying the specification considering these features; designing
    the reusable components; and building the project architecture with the new component
    library version.

    reusing code for different C # platforms, indicating that .NET 5 and new versions
    shall be used for reusing code in different platforms. This chapter also reinforced
    the principles of object-oriented programming when reusing code and presented
    generics as a sophisticated implementation to simplify the treatment of objects
    with the same characteristics. In the next chapter, we will learn how to apply
    a **service-oriented architecture** (**SOA**) with .NET Core.'

    in sophisticated environments.
