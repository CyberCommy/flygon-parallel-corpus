- en: '[Chapter 1](ch01.html "Chapter 1. Introducing Penetration Testing"), *Introducing
    Penetration Testing*, provides an introduction to what pentesting is and an explanation
    that pentesting is a component of professional security testing, and it is a validation
    of vulnerabilities. This means "exploitation", and in most cases, in a contracted
    pentest, the client does not have a clear understanding of this.'

    the Virtual Environment*, discusses the different virtual environment platforms
    there are to choose from. We also look at most of the main virtual technology
    platforms that exist.'

    what is required to plan a test environment. We also discuss the process of searching
    and finding vulnerabilities to test and creating a lab environment to test a type
    of vulnerability.'

    a Methodology*, explores a sample group of a number of testing methodologies.
    The format and steps of this sample set will be presented so that as a tester,
    you can make a comparison and adapt a methodology.'
