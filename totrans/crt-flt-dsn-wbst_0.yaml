- en: Flat design is a digital style of design that has been one of the biggest trends
    in recent years in web and user interface design. It is famous for its extremely
    minimalistic style. It has appeared at a time when skeuomorphic, a style of creating
    realistic interfaces, was considered to be the biggest and most famous trend,
    making this a really rough and extreme transition for both users and designers.

    explains what flat design is, its history since the introduction of the international
    typographic style, and how it has evolved over the years. We will also understand
    what brands helped bring the flat design to light and how this style became more
    evident as a trend for more brands and interfaces, such as the recently released
    iOS 7 from Apple.'

- en: Throughout this book, we will be creating a design of a web page and develop
    some code, specifically HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (with the help of jQuery). For
    the design, we will be using Photoshop, and any version from CS4 onwards will
    suffice. For the code, we will require a code editor such as Sublime Text, which
    may be downloaded and evaluated for free from [http://sublimetext.com](http://sublimetext.com);
    it's a great piece of software. You can also use any other code editor of your
    preference, such as Notepad++ for Windows ([http://notepad-plus-plus.org/](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/)),
    Coda ([http://panic.com/coda/](http://panic.com/coda/))for Linux, or Espresso
    ([http://macrabbit.com/espresso/](http://macrabbit.com/espresso/)) for Mac.

    Ideally, you should have some prior knowledge of design notions, but it is essential
    to know how to use Photoshop at a beginner/medium level. This is also written
    for designers who already have some knowledge on frontend development, as we will
    develop a website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (with the help of jQuery).
