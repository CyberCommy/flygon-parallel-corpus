- en: '*Learn Kali Linux 2019* is an excellent book filled with amazing content and
    exercises designed with a student-centric approach, making it easy to adapt to
    and follow through each chapter easily. *Learn Kali Linux 2019* starts by introducing
    the reader to ethical hacking concepts and threat actors, before gradually moving
    into penetration testing approaches and methodologies. Each chapter smoothly flows
    onto the next. With each step along the journey, the stages of penetration testing
    are outlined, with the help of in-depth theory and hands-on labs using one of
    the most popular penetration testing platforms, Kali Linux.'
