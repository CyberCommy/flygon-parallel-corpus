- en: Blockchain is seen as the main technological solution for a public ledger for
    all cryptocurrency transactions. This book serves as a practical guide to developing
    a fully-fledged decentralized application with Python to interact with the various
    building blocks of Blockchain applications.

- en: '*Hands-On Blockchain for Python Developers* starts by demonstrating how blockchain
    technology and cryptocurrency hashing works. You will understand the fundamentals
    and benefits of smart contracts, such as censorship resistance and transaction
    accuracy. As you steadily progress, you''ll go on to build smart contracts using
    Vyper, which has a similar syntax to Python. This experience will further help
    you unravel the other benefits of smart contracts, such as reliable storage and
    backup, and efficiency. You''ll also use web3.py to interact with smart contracts
    and leverage the power of both the web3.py and Populus frameworks to build decentralized
    applications that offer security and seamless integration with cryptocurrencies.
    As you explore later chapters, you''ll learn how to create your own token on top
    of Ethereum and build a cryptocurrency wallet graphical user interface (GUI) that
    can handle Ethereum and Ethereum Request for Comments (ERC-20) tokens using the
    PySide2 library. This will enable users to seamlessly store, send, and receive
    digital money. Toward the end, you''ll implement InterPlanetary File System (IPFS)
    technology in your decentralized application to provide a peer-to-peer filesystem
    that can store and expose media.'
