- en: Django, written in Python, is a web application framework designed to build
    complex web applications quickly without any hassle. It loosely follows the MVC
    pattern and adheres to the Don't Repeat ourself principle, which makes a database-driven
    application efficient and highly scalable, and is by far the most popular and
    mature Python web framework.

- en: This book is a manual that will help you build a simple yet an effective Django
    web application. It starts by introducing Django to you and teaches you how to
    set it up and code simple programs. You will then learn to build your first Twitter-like
    application. Later on, you will be introduced to hashtags, Ajax (to enhance the
    user interface), and tweets. You will then move on to create an administration
    interface, learn database connectivity, and use third-party libraries. Then, you
    will learn to debug and deploy Django projects and will also get a glimpse of
    Django with AngularJS and Elasticsearch. By the end of this book, you will be
    able to leverage the Django framework to develop a fully functional web application
    with minimal effort.
