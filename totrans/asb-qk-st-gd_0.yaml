- en: This is an Ansible guidebook for beginner systems administrators. It aims to
    properly introduce Ansible as an automation and configuration management tool.
    Readers of the book should, by the end, master basic use of Ansible playbooks
    and modules by learning from real-life sample codes that demonstrate each module's
    functionality to help achieve infrastructure and task automation and orchestration.
    The book contains some extra advanced tips for those who want to go the extra
    mile and learn about and collaborate with the Ansible community.

- en: This book is for three major audiences. First, systems administrators who work
    with either Linux, Windows, or Mac OS X. This covers those who work on bare-metal
    machines, virtual infrastructure, or cloud-based environments. Then, network administrators,
    those who work on distributed proprietary network equipment. Finally, DevOps.
    This book offers a good understanding of how the system they are going to deploy
    their application in will behave, enabling them to code accordingly or suggest
    modifications that can benefit their applications.

- en: Before reading this book, you should have a basic understanding of the Linux
    shell and some system administration skills in order to be able to follow the
    practical examples. Also, some basic coding skills will be very handy when dealing
    with YAML playbooks. As an optional requirement, having some basic knowledge of
    configuration management will help to simplify many points in the book.

    running at least two Linux machines, a Windows machine, and a Mac OS X. For network
    device testing, you may need a test network device or some virtual network equipment.
