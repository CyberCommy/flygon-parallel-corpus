    if you have a set of actions that must be done repeatedly to accomplish some goal.
    For example, the `while` loop in the following code repeatedly prints the value
    of the variable `x` as it is incremented from `1` to 5:'

    Then, we go to the `while` condition. The `while` condition says that while `x`
    is less than or equal to `5`, you must stay in the block of code that follows.

    `{` and `}` once) gets a little more done from the task (of printing the numbers
    `1` to `5`). We program the loop to exit automatically once the task is done (when
    `x <= 5` is no longer true).
  prefs: []

    block by the `while` loop is only allowed if you meet the condition within the
    brackets of the `while` loop (in the preceding example, `x <= 5`). You can try
    mentally subbing an `if` loop in the place of the `while` loop, as shown in the

    the preceding example, once the value of `x` becomes 6 (so `x <= 5` becomes false),
    we will not enter the `while` loop again. Since the orange portal is inside the
    loop, we'll be able to exit the loop once `x` becomes 6.

    second statement inside the `for` loop (`x <= 5;`) is the loop's repeat condition.
    As long as `x <= 5`, we must continue to stay inside the body of the `for` loop.

    after we complete the body of the `for` loop each time.
