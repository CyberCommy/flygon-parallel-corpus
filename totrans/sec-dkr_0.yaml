- en: Docker is the hottest buzzword in technology these days! This book helps you
    to ensure that you are securing all the pieces in the Docker ecosystems of tools.
    Keeping your data and systems safe is of utmost importance these days, and with
    Docker, it's the same exception. Learn how Docker is inherently secure and how
    to secure the pieces around it even more and be on the lookout for potential vulnerabilities
    as they take place.

    "Chapter 1. Securing Docker Hosts"), *Securing Docker Hosts*, starts off the book
    by discussing how to secure the first part of getting your Docker environment
    up and running, and that is by focusing on your Docker hosts. The Docker hosts
    are the platform that your containers will run on. Without securing these first,
    it''s like leaving the front door to your house wide open.'
