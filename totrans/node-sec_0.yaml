- en: Node.js is a fast-growing platform for building server applications using JavaScript.
    Now that it is being used more widely in production settings, Node.js applications
    will begin to be specifically targeted for security vulnerabilities. Protecting
    your users will require the understanding of attack vectors that are unique to
    Node.js as well as those shared with other web application platforms.
