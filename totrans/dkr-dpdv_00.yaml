  prefs:

- en: Docker is here and there’s no point hiding. Developers are all over it, and
    IT Ops need to be on their game! We damn well better know how to build and support
    production-quality *containerized* apps in our business-critical environments.
    This book will help you.

    flipped on its head!
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Containerized* apps need somewhere to run and someone to manage them. If you
    think developers are going to do that, you’re dreaming. Ops will need to build
    and run high-performance production-grade Docker infrastructures. If you’ve got
    an Ops focus and you’re not skilled-up on Docker, you’re in for a world of pain.
    But don’t stress, the book will skill you up!'
