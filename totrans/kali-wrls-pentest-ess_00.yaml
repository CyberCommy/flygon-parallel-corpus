- en: Since their introduction to the market less than 20 years ago, wireless networks
    have grown exponentially and become ubiquitous, not only in the enterprises but
    everywhere else—all kinds of public places (coffee shops, restaurants, shopping
    malls, stations, and airports), open-air free Wi-Fi zones, and private homes.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Like all other technologies, their spread has led to a growing need for assessing
    and improving their security, as a vulnerable wireless network offers an easy
    way for an attacker to access and attack the whole network, as we will see through
    this book.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For these reasons, the process of the security assessment of wireless networks,
    also called wireless penetration testing, has become an essential part of more
    general network penetration testing.

- en: In this book, we explore the whole process of performing wireless penetration
    tests with the renowned security distribution of Kali Linux, analyzing each phase,
    from the initial planning to the final reporting. We cover the basic theory of
    wireless security (protocols, vulnerabilities, and attacks) but mainly focus on
    the practical aspects, using the valuable, free, and open source tools provided
    by Kali Linux for wireless penetration testing.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 1](ch01.html "Chapter 1. Introduction to Wireless Penetration Testing"),
    *Introduction to Wireless Penetration Testing*, presents the general concepts
    of penetration testing and covers its four main phases with a particular focus
    on wireless networks.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The chapter explains how to agree and plan a penetration test with the customer
    and gives a high-level view on the information collection, attack execution, and
    report writing phases of the process.

- en: '[Chapter 2](ch02.html "Chapter 2. Setting Up Your Machine with Kali Linux"),
    *Setting Up Your Machine with Kali Linux*, introduces the Kali Linux distribution
    and the included tools that are specifically designed for wireless penetration
    testing. Then we see the hardware requirements for its installation, the different
    installation methods, and also cover, step by step, installation in a VirtualBox
    machine, supplying the relative screenshot for every step.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: After installing Kali Linux, the chapter exposes the features that the wireless
    adapter must meet to be suitable for our purposes and how to practically test
    these requisites.

- en: '[Chapter 3](ch03.html "Chapter 3. WLAN Reconnaissance"), *WLAN Reconnaissance*,
    discusses the discovery or information gathering phase of wireless penetration
    testing. It begins with the basic theory of the 802.11 standard and wireless local
    area networks (WLANs) and then covers the concept of wireless scanning that is
    the process of identifying and gathering information about wireless networks.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We then learn how to use the tools included in Kali Linux to perform wireless
    network scanning, showing practical examples.

- en: '[Chapter 4](ch04.html "Chapter 4. WEP Cracking"), *WEP Cracking*, speaks about
    the WEP security protocol, analyzing its design, its vulnerabilities and the various
    attacks that have been developed against it.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The chapter illustrates how command-line tools and automated tools can be used
    to perform different variants of these attacks to crack the WEP key, demonstrating
    that WEP is an insecure protocol and should never be used!
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 5](ch05.html "Chapter 5. WPA/WPA2 Cracking"), *WPA/WPA2 Cracking*,
    starts with the description of WPA/WPA2 cracking, its design and features, and
    shows that it is secure. We see that WPA can be susceptible to attacks only if
    weak keys are used. In this chapter, we cover the various tools to run brute force
    and dictionary attacks to crack WPA keys. Also, recent and effective techniques
    for WPA cracking such as GPU and cloud computing are covered.'

- en: '[Chapter 6](ch06.html "Chapter 6. Attacking Access Points and the Infrastructure"),
    *Attacking Access Points and the Infrastructure*, covers attacks targeting WPA-Enterprise,
    access points, and the wired network infrastructure. It introduces WPA-Enterprise,
    the different authentication protocols it uses and explains how to identify them
    with a packet analyzer. Then, it covers the tools and techniques to crack the
    WPA-Enterprise key.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The other attacks covered in the chapter are the Denial of Service attack against
    access points, forcing the de-authentication of the connected clients, the rogue
    access point attack and the attack against the default authentication credentials
    of access points.

- en: '[Chapter 7](ch07.html "Chapter 7. Wireless Client Attacks"), *Wireless Client
    Attacks*, covers attacks targeting isolated wireless clients to recover the WEP
    and the WPA keys and illustrates how to set up a fake access point to impersonate
    a legitimate one and lure clients to connect to it (an Evil Twin attack). Once
    the client is connected to the fake access point, we show how to conduct the so-called
    Man-in-the-middle attacks using the tools available with Kali Linux.'

    Conclusions*, discusses the last phase of a penetration test, which is the reporting
    phase, explaining its essential concepts and focusing, in particular, on the reasons
    and purposes of a professional and well-written report.'
