- en: Qt is a cross-platform application development framework designed to create
    great software applications with amazing user interfaces for desktop, embedded,
    and mobile platforms. It provides developers with a great set of tools for designing
    and building great applications without having to worry about platform dependency.

- en: In this book, we will focus on Qt 6, the latest version of the Qt framework.
    This book will help you with creating user-friendly and functional graphical user
    interfaces. You will also gain an advantage over competitors by providing better-looking
    applications with a consistent look and feel across different platforms.

- en: Developers who want to build a cross-platform application with an interactive
    GUI will be able to put their knowledge to work with this practical guide. The
    book provides a hands-on approach to implementing the concepts and associated
    mechanism that will have your application up-and-running in no time. You will
    also be provided explanation for essential concepts with examples to give you
    a complete learning experience.

- en: You will begin by exploring the Qt framework across different platforms. You
    will learn how to configure Qt on different platforms, understand different Qt
    modules, learn core concepts, and learn how they can be used to build efficient
    GUI applications. You will be able to build, run, test, and deploy applications
    across different platforms. You will also learn to customize the look and feel
    of the application and develop a translation aware application. Apart from learning
    the complete application process, the book will also help you in identifying the
    bottlenecks and how to address them in order to enhance the performance of your
    application.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book is intended for developers and programmers who want to build GUI-based
    applications. It is also intended for software engineers who have coded in C++
    before. The entry barrier isn't that high, so if you understand basics C++ and
    OOPS concepts, then you can embark on this journey.

- en: In addition, this book can help intermediate-level Qt developers, who want to
    build and deploy in other platforms. Working professionals or students, who want
    to get started with Qt programming, as well as programmers who are new to Qt,
    will find this book useful.
