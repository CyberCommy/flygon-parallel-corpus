- en: '*Learning Android Forensics* uses free open source tools to show you how to
    forensically recover data from Android devices. All of you, from beginners to
    experts, are encouraged to follow along with step-by-step directions to learn
    how to acquire and examine evidence and gain a deeper understanding of the Android
    forensic process. Commercial forensic tools typically give an examiner a button
    to press (commonly called the Find Evidence button). This book goes behind the
    scenes and shows what many of these tools are actually doing, giving you much
    deeper knowledge of how they work. Commercial forensic tools also frequently fail
    to recover data from third-party applications; there are simply too many apps
    available to write a tool that covers all of them. This book shows you how to
    manually analyze over a dozen popular applications. It teaches techniques and
    procedures for understanding data that can be carried over to analyzing almost
    any other application.'
