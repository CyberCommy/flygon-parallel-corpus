- en: This Appendix shows a version of the code from appendices B and C that extracts
    the domain logic from the page script into a *Transactions* class. Note how the
    original page script is now reduced to being a object creation and injection mechanism,
    and hands off most logic to the *Transactions* classes. Note also how the `$failure`,
    `$credits`, and `$article_types` variables are now properties on the Transactions
    class, and how the normalization/sanitizing logic and credit-calculation logic
    is part of the *Transactions* logic.
