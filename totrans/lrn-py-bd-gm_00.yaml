- en: In September of 2018, I was teaching some of my students about game programming
    and automation using Python. Then, I realized that it was time to create a book
    that not only offers information on the rich content of game programming using
    Python but also shows how to make and deploy games that mimic real, world-famous
    games such as Flappy Bird and Angry Birds. I wanted to equip you with all the
    essentials and primitives of game programming to become a real-world Python game
    developer. This book is not your usual and traditional Python theoretical book;
    our approach will be as practical as possible. Each chapter will contain a single,
    yet powerful, real-world game example that will not only be interesting but will
    also edify you with programming paradigms, which will be your first step to becoming
    a proficient Python developer.

    to a survey conducted by Stack Overflow and TIOBE, and its rate of popularity
    growth is not expected to decrease any time soon. If you observe what big tech
    companies use for handling their businesses, you can see that they depend highly upon
    Python because of its easy usage and rapid prototyping. Not only that, but you
    can also see that Python can be used to develop a variety of applications ranging
    from data science to high-end web applications, and as you proceed to learn the
    basics of Python, you will be ready to create almost anything you want.

- en: There are many reasons to learn Python, and a big one is the Python community.
    Many of the world's greatest developers contribute incessantly to this Python
    community by adding new libraries/modules and functionalities. These libraries
    prove to be extremely helpful if you want to create something new and rapidly.
    As such, Python is focused on products rather than being bogged down in the routines
    and complexities of low-level programming, which makes it the most loved programming
    language of beginners.

- en: In this book, we will start by introducing some important programming concepts,
    such as variables, numbers, Boolean logic, conditionals, and looping. After building
    a solid foundation of core programming concepts, we will hop into advanced sections
    such as data structures and functions. The pace of learning will be increased
    with the difficulty of the chapters. After finishing [Chapter 7](2d97aa5e-7fdd-459d-9c73-626e29c3a0ed.xhtml),
    *List Comprehension and Properties*, we will be fully equipped with all the basics
    to be applied while creating advanced things such as flappy bird emulators, angry
    bird emulators, and AI players. In each chapter, there will be a *game testing
    and possible modification* topic to compel you to think about how errors should
    be handled and how programs should be refined.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To get a good grasp of each of the topics written about in this book, I encourage
    you to follow along with the source code and examples. To write code properly,
    you will need to install Python on your machine. I have used Python's latest version
    (as of September 2019), version 3.7, but you can use any version newer than 3.5+.
    The thorough installation process of Python is covered in the first chapter for
    your machine, based on the OS (Linux, macOS, or Windows) you're using. You will
    also need an internet connection up and running to download GitHub code and Python
    third-party libraries. We will be installing different Python libraries, including
    PyGame, Pymunk, and PyOpenGL later in this book. For each of them, the installation
    process will be covered in the chapter concerned. While using such modules, our
    programs will tend to become lengthier, so we strongly encourage you to use a
    good Python text editor. I will be using the PyCharm IDE to create complex games
    using Python, and its installation is also covered in the first chapter. Apart
    from these software requirements, there are no specific requirements for this
    book.

    someone who has tried learning it previously, but a boring course or book set
    you off track, or someone who wants to brush up on their skills. This book will
    help you gain core knowledge and advance your skills in the most interesting way:
    by building games. It primarily focuses on GUI programming using the Python modules
    PyGame, PyOpenGL, and Pymunk. No programming skills are expected from learners
    as we will cover everything you need to know about Python in this book. We will
    study the `turtle` module by building three mini-games, and you will learn how
    to create your very own 2D games, even if you are a complete beginner. If you
    ever wanted to explore game development with Python''s PyGame module, this book
    is for you.'

    to follow along with the examples. Prior knowledge of Python is not required,
    but experience of mathematical concepts such as arithmetic and logical operations
    is essential for understanding the code thoroughly. Python-based applications
    are not limited to any particular OS, so all that is required is a decent code
    editor and a browser. Throughout the book, we have used the PyCharm Community
    2019.2 editor, which is an open source editor and is free to download.
