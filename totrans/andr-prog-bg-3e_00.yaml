    companion for creating Android applications from scratch. We will introduce you
    to all the fundamental concepts of programming in an Android context, from the
    basics of Java to working with the Android API. All examples use the up-to-date
    API classes and are created from within Android Studio, the official Android development
    environment that helps supercharge your application development process.

- en: '[*Chapter 1*](B16773_01_ePub_RK.xhtml#_idTextAnchor014), *Beginning Android
    and Java*, will see you not waste any time in getting started with developing
    Android apps. We will look at what is so great about Android, what exactly Android
    and Java are, how they work and complement each other, and what that means to
    us as future developers. Moving quickly on, we will set up the required software
    so that we can build and deploy a simple first app.'

    XML, and the UI Designer*, explains how, at this stage, we have a working Android
    development environment and we have built and deployed our first app. We need
    to explore this autogenerated code so that we can begin to understand Android
    and then learn how to build on this useful template'

    Studio and the Project Structure*, explains how to create and run two more Android
    projects. The purpose of these exercises is to explore in more depth Android Studio
    and the structure of Android projects. Along with understanding the composition
    of our projects, it will also be beneficial to make sure we get the most from
    the emulator.'

- en: '[*Chapter 4*](B16773_04_ePub_RK.xhtml#_idTextAnchor076), *Getting Started with
    Layouts and Material Design*, covers the building of three more layouts—still
    quite simple, yet a step up from what we have done so far. Before we get hands-on,
    we will have a quick introduction to the concept of Material Design. We will also
    cover the different types of layout called LinearLayout, ConstraintLayout, and
    TableLayout. We will also write some Java code to switch between our different
    layouts within a single app/project. This is the first major app that links together
    multiple topics in one neat parcel.'

    with CardView and ScrollView*, is the final chapter on layouts before we spend
    some time focusing on Java and object-oriented programming. We will formalize
    our learning on some of the different attributes we have already encountered,
    and we will also introduce two more cool layouts: ScrollView and CardView. To
    conclude this chapter, we will run a CardView project on a tablet emulator.'

- en: '[*Chapter 6*](B16773_06_ePub_RK.xhtml#_idTextAnchor119), *The Android Lifecycle*,
    will see us become familiar with the lifecycle of an Android app. The lifecycle
    is the way that all Android apps interact with the Android OS. We will see the
    phases of the lifecycle that an app goes through, from creation to destruction,
    and how this helps us know where to put our Java code, depending on what we are
    trying to achieve.'

- en: '[*Chapter 7*](B16773_07_ePub_RK.xhtml#_idTextAnchor134), *Java Variables, Operators,
    and Expressions*, covers the core fundamentals of Java: the code that goes into
    the classes and the methods that we create, along with the data that the code
    acts upon. In this chapter, we will focus on the data. We will dive into learning
    how to write our very own Java code. By the end of the chapter, you will be comfortable
    writing Java code that creates and uses data within Android.'

    Loops*, explains how we can take a course of action dependent upon the value of
    a variable. We will look at making decisions in Java with `if`, `else`, and `switch`.
    We will also look at loops in Java with `while`, `do` – `while`, `for`, and `break`.'

    to make them execute their code, there is more to them than we have discussed
    hitherto.'

- en: '[*Chapter 10*](B16773_10_ePub_RK.xhtml#_idTextAnchor187), *Object-Oriented
    Programming*, explains how in Java, classes are fundamental to just about everything.
    We will begin to understand why the software engineers at Sun Microsystems back
    in the early 1990s made Java the way they did. We have already talked about reusing
    other people''s code, specifically the Android API, but in this chapter, we will
    really get to grips with how this works and learn about object-oriented programming
    and how to use it.'

    Programming*, is the second part of our whirlwind tour (theoretical and practical)
    into OOP. We have already briefly discussed the concepts of encapsulation, inheritance,
    and polymorphism, but in this chapter, we will get to see them in action in some
    demo apps. While the working examples will show these concepts in their simplest
    forms, it will still be a significant stepping stone toward taking control of
    our XML layouts via our Java code.'

    and the Garbage Collector*, reveals the missing link between Java and our XML
    layouts, leaving us with the power to add all kinds of widgets to our apps, as
    we have done before, but this time we will be able to control them through our
    Java code. In this chapter, we will get to take control of some fairly simple
    UI elements, such as Button and TextView. To enable us to understand what is happening,
    we need to find out a bit more about the memory in an Android device and two areas
    of it—the Stack and the Heap.'

    – Bringing Android Widgets to Life*, explains how, now that we have a good overview
    of both the layout and coding of an Android app, as well as our newly acquired
    insight into object-oriented programming and how we can manipulate the UI from
    our Java code, we are ready to experiment with more widgets from the palette alongside
    anonymous classes. In this chapter, we will diversify a lot by going back to the
    Android Studio palette and looking around at half a dozen widgets that we have
    either not seen at all or have not used fully yet. Once we have done so, we will
    put them all into a layout and practice manipulating them with Java code.'

    covers how to present the user with a pop-up dialog window. We can then put all
    that we know into the first phase of our first major app, Note to self. We will
    also then learn about new Android and Java features in this chapter and the four
    following (up to [*Chapter 18*](B16773_18_ePub_RK.xhtml#_idTextAnchor320)), and
    then use our newly acquired knowledge to enhance the Note to self app each time.
    In each chapter, we will also build a selection of smaller apps that are separate
    from this main app.'

    Random Numbers*, talks about Java arrays, which allow us to manipulate a potentially
    huge amount of data in an organized and efficient manner. We will also use a close
    Java relation to arrays, the ArrayList, and see the differences between them.
    Once we are comfortable handling substantial amounts of data, we will see what
    the Android API has in order to help us easily connect our new-found data handling
    skills to the UI without breaking sweat.'

    first covers the theory of adapters and lists. We will learn how to extend RecyclerAdapter
    in Java code and add a RecyclerView, which acts as a list to our UI, and then,
    through the apparent magic of the Android API, bind them together so that RecyclerView
    displays the contents of RecyclerAdapter and allows the user to scroll through
    the contents.'

    and Sharing*, examines a couple of different ways to save data to the Android
    device''s permanent storage. Also, for the first time, we will add a second activity
    to our app. It often makes sense when implementing a separate "screen", such as
    a settings screen in our app, to do so in a new activity. We will see how to add
    an activity and navigate the user between them.'

    and a bit more interesting. As we have come to expect, the Android API will allow
    us to do some quite advanced things with relatively straightforward code, and
    the Animation class is no different.'

    is devoted to the Android Canvas class and a number of related classes, such as
    Paint, Color, and Bitmap. These classes combined bring great power when it comes
    to drawing to the screen. If we want to make a drawing app, draw graphs, or perhaps
    a game, we need to take control of every pixel that the Android device has to
    offer.'

    style drawing app where the user can draw on the screen with their finger. This
    drawing app will be slightly different, however. The lines that the user draws
    will comprise particle systems that explode into thousands of pieces. We will
    call the project *Live Drawing*.'

    and evolve in this real-time system as if they have a mind of their own and form
    the appearance of the drawings that the user can achieve. We will also see how
    the user draws these entities by learning how to respond to interaction with the
    screen. This is different to interacting with a widget in a UI layout.'

    Versions of Android, Sound Effects, and Spinner Widget*, explains how we can detect
    and handle different versions of Android. We will then be able to study the SoundPool
    class and the different ways we use it, depending on the Android version the app
    is running on. At this point, we can then put everything we have learned into
    producing a cool sound demo app that will also introduce us to a new UI widget
    – the Spinner.'

    in the book so far. We will look at a few aspects of Java and Android that you
    can use as a framework or template for making ever more exciting and complex apps
    at the same time as keeping the code manageable. Furthermore, I will suggest areas
    of further study that there is simply not enough room to even scratch the surface

    Image Gallery App*, explains how to create an app using paging and swiping with
    images as you might find in a photo gallery app. Also, using the RecyclerView
    widget, we will selectively load just the data required for the current page and
    perhaps the data for the previous and next pages.'

    Navigation Drawer and Fragment*, covers what is (arguably) the most advanced UI.
    NavigationView can be created simply by choosing it as a template when you create
    a new project. We will then examine the autogenerated code and learn how to interact
    with it. Then, we will use all we know about Fragment to populate each of the
    "drawers" with different behaviors and views.'

    explains how, if we are going to make apps that offer our users significant features,
    then almost certainly we are going to need a way to manage, store, and filter
    significant amounts of data. JSON and SharedPreferences classes have their place
    but, at some point, we need to move on to using real databases for real-world
    solutions. Android uses the SQLite database management system and, as you would
    expect, there is an API to make it as easy as possible.'
