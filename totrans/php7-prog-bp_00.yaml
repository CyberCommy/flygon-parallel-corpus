- en: PHP is a great language for developing web applications. It is essentially a
    server-side scripting language that is also used for general-purpose programming.
    PHP 7 is the latest version, which provides major backward-compatibility breaks
    and focuses on providing improved performance and speed. With the rise in demand
    for high performance, this newest version contains everything you need to build
    efficient applications. PHP 7 provides improved engine execution, better memory
    usage, and a better set of tools allowing you to maintain high traffic on your
    websites with low-cost hardware and servers through a multithreading web server.
