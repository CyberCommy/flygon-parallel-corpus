- en: 'For some years, web development has evolved through frameworks. Web development
    has become more efficient and has improved in quality. Django is a very sophisticated
    and popular framework. A framework is a set of tools designed to facilitate and
    standardize development. It allows the developer to benefit from very practical
    tools to minimize the development time. However, developing with frameworks requires
    knowledge about the framework and its proper usage. This book uses a step-by-step
    pedagogy to help novice developers learn how to easily deal with the Django framework.
    The examples in this book explain the development of a simple web tool: a text-based
    task manager.'
