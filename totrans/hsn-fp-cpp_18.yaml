    how function chaining and composition helps to create designs that are modular
    and composable. Yet, we hit a problem—with our current approach, a lot of data
    needs to be copied from one collection to another.

    a solution available in purely functional programming languages—lazy evaluation.
    The library, called **ranges**, was then officially accepted into the C++ 20 standard.
    In this chapter, we will see how to take advantage of it.

- en: So, what does the ranges library offer? Well, it all starts from the concept
    of range. A range is formed by a begin and an end iterator. This allows us, for
    starters, to add a range on top of an existing collection. Then, we can pass a
    range to an algorithm that requires a begin and end iterator (such as `transform`,
    `sort`, or `accumulate`), hence removing the inconvenient calls to `begin()` and
    `end()`.

- en: 'With ranges, we can build views. Views specify that we are interested in a
    partial or full collection through the two iterators, but also to allow lazy evaluation
    and composability. Since views are just lightweight wrappers on top of a collection,
    we can declare a chain of operations without actually executing them until the
    result is needed. We will see in detail how this works in the next section, but
    here''s a simple example composing two operations that will filter all numbers
    from a collection that are multiples of six by filtering first *all of the even
    numbers*, followed by filtering the numbers that are *multiples of 3*:'

    than creating a copy. As we''ve discussed many times previously, we prefer not
    to mutate data in functional programming; however, there are cases when we can
    optimize performance with this solution, so it''s worth mentioning. Here''s an
