  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Interviews at big companies are relatively long processes with progressively
    increasing complexity of technical questions and coding challenges (such an interview
    process can take a month or even more). Most companies prefer one or more technical
    phone screens, on-site technical challenges, and in-person interviews before making
    an offer. Commonly, one of these interviews will be non-technical (known as a
    *lunch interview*).

    and coding challenges). There will be 4-5 people involved in these technical phone
    screens. One of the phone screens will be non-technical. At this moment, feel

    face-to-face interviews. A team of interviewers from different areas of the business
    will individually conduct an interview and evaluate your technical skills (including
    coding). One of them is also known as the *bar raiser* guy. Commonly, this guy
    is the most experienced, and his questions and coding challenges will be harder.
    They will evaluate you against other candidates as well, and they will decide
    whether to make an offer or not.

    internal playbooks. If a step doesn't pass their internal playbooks, then it can
    lead to a sudden closure of the interview. But, the most important steps are steps
    3, 5, 6, and 7\. Step 3 represents an eliminatory **Criteria Cognitive Aptitude
    Test** (**CCAT**). For example, you have to answer 50 questions in 15 minutes.
    You have to answer correctly 25+ questions to have a chance to advance to the
    next step. If you are not familiar with CCAT tests, then it is strongly recommended
    to practice (there are books and websites dedicated to CCAT tests). Without serious
    practice, it will be quite challenging to pass it. If you are not a native English
    speaker, then you have to pay extra attention to practice the questions that require
    serious English skills.
