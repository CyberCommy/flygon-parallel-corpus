- en: JavaScript is a core programming language for web technology that can be used
    to modify both HTML and CSS. It is frequently abbreviated to just JS. JavaScript
    is used for processes that go on in the user interfaces of most web browsers,
    such as Internet Explorer, Google Chrome, and Mozilla Firefox. It is the most
    widely-used client-side scripting language today, due to its ability to make the
    browser do its work.

- en: In this book, you will gain a deep understanding of JavaScript. You will learn
    how to write JavaScript in a professional environment using the new JavaScript
    syntax in ES6, how to leverage JavaScript's asynchronous nature using callbacks
    and promises, and how to set up test suites and test your code. You will be introduced
    to JavaScript's functional programming style and you will apply everything you
    learn to build a simple application in various JavaScript frameworks and libraries
    for backend and frontend development.

- en: This book is designed to target anyone who wants to write JavaScript in a professional
    environment. We expect the audience to have used JavaScript in some capacity and
    be familiar with the basic syntax. This book would be good for a tech enthusiast
    wondering when to use generators or how to use Promises and Callbacks effectively,
    or a novice developer who wants to deepen their knowledge on JavaScript and understand
    TDD.
