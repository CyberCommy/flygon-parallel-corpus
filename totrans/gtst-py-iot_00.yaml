- en: This Learning Path takes you on a journey in the world of robotics and teaches
    you all that you can achieve with Raspberry Pi and Python.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It teaches you to harness the power of Python with the Raspberry Pi 3 and the
    Raspberry Pi zero to build superlative automation systems that can transform your
    business. You will learn to create text classifiers, predict sentiment in words,
    and develop applications with the Tkinter library. Things will get more interesting
    when you build a human face detection and recognition system and a home automation
    system in Python, where different appliances are controlled using the Raspberry
    Pi. With such diverse robotics projects, you'll grasp the basics of robotics and
    its functions, and understand the integration of robotics with the IoT environment.

    a robotic controller, to creating a self-driven robotic vehicle using Python.
