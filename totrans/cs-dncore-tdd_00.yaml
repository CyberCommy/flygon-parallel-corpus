- en: How do you verify that your cross-platform .NET Core application will work wherever
    it is deployed? As your business, team, and the technical environment evolves,
    can your code evolve with it? You can simplify your code base, make finding and
    fixing bugs trivial, and ensure your code does what you think it does by following
    the principles of test-driven development.

- en: This book guides developers through the process of creating robust, production-ready
    C# 7 and .NET Core applications by establishing a professional test-driven development
    process. To do this, you will begin by learning the stages of the TDD life cycle,
    some best practices, and some anti-patterns.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: After covering the basics of TDD in the first chapter, you will get right into
    creating a sample ASP.NET Core MVC application. You will learn how to write testable
    code with SOLID principles, and set up dependency injection.

- en: Next, you will learn how to create unit tests using the xUnit.net testing framework,
    and how to use its attributes and assertions. Once you have the basics in place,
    you will learn how to create data-driven unit tests and how to mock dependencies
    in your code.

- en: At the end of this book, you will wrap up by creating a healthy continuous integration
    process, using GitHub, TeamCity, VSTS, and Cake. Finally, you will modify the
    Continuous Integration build to test, version, and package a sample application.

    .NET Core and C# 7\. You will learn by doing as we create an ASP.NET MVC application
    on Ubuntu Linux with test-driven development principles.'

    Code*, demonstrates that, in order to reap the benefits of a test-driven development
    cycle, you must write code that is testable. In this chapter, we will discuss
    the SOLID principles for creating testable code and learn how to set up our .NET
    core application for dependency injection.'

    presents the unit testing frameworks available for .NET Core and C#. We will use
    the xUnit framework to create a shared test context of setup and teardown code.
    You will also understand how to create basic unit tests and prove the results
    of your unit tests with xUnit assertions.'

    Tests*, presents concepts that allow you to test your code over a variety of inputs
    by running over a set of data, either inline or from a data source. In this chapter,
    we will create data-driven unit tests or theories in xUnit.'

    that mock objects are simulated objects that mimic the behavior of real objects.
    In this chapter, you will learn how to use the Moq framework to isolate the class
    you''re testing from its dependencies using mock objects created with Moq.'

    of quickly providing feedback on code quality. A continuous integration process
    extends this feedback cycle to uncovering code integration issues. In this chapter,
    you will begin creating a continuous integration process that can provide rapid
    feedback on code quality and integration issues across a development team.'

    brings together many different steps into an easily repeatable process. In this
    chapter, you will configure TeamCity and VSTS to use a cross-platform build automation
    system called Cake to clean, build, restore package dependencies and test your
    solution.'

    of xUnit tests. You will finish up the process by versioning and packaging an
    application for distribution on the various platforms that .NET Core supports.'
