- en: If you want to take advantage of the real power of Boost and C++ and avoid the
    confusion about which library to use in which situation, then this book is for
    you.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Beginning with the basics of Boost C++, you will move on to learn how the Boost
    libraries simplify application development. You will learn to convert data, such
    as string to numbers, numbers to string, numbers to numbers, and more. Managing
    resources will become a piece of cake. You'll see what kind of work can be done
    at compile time and what Boost containers can do. You will learn everything for
    the development of high-quality, fast, and portable applications. Write a program
    once, and then you can use it on Linux, Windows, macOS, and Android operating
    systems. From manipulating images to graphs, directories, timers, files, and networking,
    everyone will find an interesting topic.

- en: '[Chapter 1](part0029.html#RL0A0-712b4ba1126a4c7c89e1d44de61b4bdd),* Starting
    to Write Your Application*, tells you about libraries for everyday use. We''ll
    see how to get configuration options from different sources and what can be cooked
    up using some of the data types introduced by Boost library authors.'

- en: '[Chapter 2](part0108.html#36VSO0-712b4ba1126a4c7c89e1d44de61b4bdd), *Managing
    Resources*, deals with data types, introduced by the Boost libraries, mostly focusing
    on working with pointers. We''ll see how to easily manage resources, and how to
    use a data type capable of storing any functional objects, functions, and lambda
    expressions. After reading this chapter, your code will become more reliable,
    and memory leaks will become history.'

    and Casting*, describes how to convert strings, numbers, and user-defined types
    to each other, how to safely cast polymorphic types, and how to write small and
    large parsers right inside the C++ source files. Multiple ways of converting data
    for everyday use and for rare cases are covered.'

    Tricks*, describes some basic examples of Boost libraries can be used in compile-time
    checking for tuning algorithms, and in other metaprogramming tasks. Understanding
    Boost sources and other Boost-like libraries is impossible without it.'

    Tasks*, shows calling the functional object a task. The main idea of this chapter
    is that we can split all the processing, computations, and interactions into functors
    (tasks) and process each of those tasks almost independently. Moreover, we may
    not block on some slow operations (such as receiving data from a socket or waiting
    for a time-out), but instead provide a callback task and continue working with
    other tasks. Once the OS finishes the slow operation, our callback will be executed.'

    We''ll see how some common string-related tasks can be easily done using the Boost
    libraries. It addresses very common string manipulation tasks.'

    presents some cool and hard-to-understand metaprogramming methods. In this chapter,
    we''ll go deeper and see how multiple types can be packed into a single tuple-like
    type. We''ll make functions to manipulate collections of types, we''ll see how
    types of compile-time collections can be changed, and how compile-time tricks
    can be mixed with runtime.'

    provides information about the Boost classes that can be used in everyday programming,
