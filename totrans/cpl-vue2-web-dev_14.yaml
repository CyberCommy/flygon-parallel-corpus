  zh: 使用Axios发送基本的AJAX请求
- en: '**Axios** is the recommended library for Vue for making HTTP requests. It''s
    a very simple library, but it has some built-in features that help you in carrying
    out common operations. It implements a REST pattern for making requests with HTTP
    verbs and can also deal with concurrency (spawning multiple requests at the same
    time) in a function call. You can find more information at [https://github.com/mzabriskie/axios](https://github.com/mzabriskie/axios).'

    the CSRF token (more on this in the next paragraph). We will suppose that the

    in your app. This means you must be very careful about using the `v-html` attribute
    (the *Output raw HTML* recipe).

    `axios.defaults.xsrfCookieName` variable, and you can edit the name of the header
    that will return the token acting on the `axios.defaults.xsrfHeaderName` variable.
