  zh: 介绍
- en: During my career, I used Visual SourceSafe, SVN, VSTS, Bitbucket, and GitHub.
    It really does not matter how you approach it, the important thing is that you
    keep your source code safe and versioned. When I first started working with source
    control, the company I worked at used Visual SourceSafe. If you are unfamiliar
    with the software, just Google it. You will see results come back containing words
    such as hate, unpleasant, bad, and Microsoft's source destruction system. You
    get the point.

  zh: 在我的职业生涯中，我使用过Visual SourceSafe、SVN、VSTS、Bitbucket和GitHub。重要的不是你如何对待它，而是你保持你的源代码安全和版本化。当我开始使用源代码控制时，我所在的公司使用了Visual
    SourceSafe。如果您对这个软件不熟悉，可以搜索一下。你会看到一些包含“讨厌”、“不愉快”、“糟糕”和“微软的源代码破坏系统”的结果。你懂的。
- en: We had an employee leave files exclusively checked out to him, after he resigned
    and emigrated to another country. I'm beginning to wonder if the company policy
    to enforce the use of SourceSafe wasn't the reason he emigrated. But jokes apart,
    it gave us endless problems. Slap SourceSafe on a large project, and you could
    end up with a disaster. These days, however, developers have excellent choices
    available to them.

  zh: 我们有一个员工离开了他独占的文件，之后他辞职并移民到另一个国家。我开始怀疑公司强制使用SourceSafe的政策是否是他移民的原因。但开玩笑的，这给我们带来了无尽的问题。在一个大型项目上使用SourceSafe，可能会导致灾难。然而，如今，开发人员有很好的选择。

- en: The choice of source control is a topic every developer has a strong opinion
    about. Unfortunately, if you work for a boss, that decision might not even be
    up to you. Many companies have already set up their source control system just
    the way they like it, and you will need to fall in with company procedure. That
    is just the way it is. It is, however, good to know about the options available
    to you as an indie developer.

    only a developer while you sit at work. We eat, breathe, sleep, and live code.
    It is part of who and what we are. I will say that in order for you to become
    better at your job as a developer, you must play with code in your own time. Start
    a pet project, get some friends together, and decide to write some software together.
    Not only will this make you all better at what you do, but you will learn a lot
    from each other.

    every day, you can still connect with the developer community. There are so many
    resources available to developers, and the developer community is more than happy
    to rally around newbies and help them grow. Starting a solo or pet project is
    useless if you don't commit (pun intended) to keeping your code safe. To do this,
    you don't have to pay a single dollar either. **Visual Studio Online** (now called
    **Team Services**) and GitHub provide developers with a fantastic platform to

- en: The free GitHub account allows you to create public repositories. This means
    that anyone is able to search for, view, and clone your project from GitHub to
    their own desktop. This is the central idea behind GitHub. This is obviously a
    key factor for indie developers and corporates that don't want to spend money.
    Corporates can afford it more than an indie developer, but I think that some companies
    prefer to roll their own, rather than use a service provider hosted in the cloud
    somewhere. This means that they prefer to keep the source control under their
    control by setting up a source control system on their own corporate servers.
    Having GitHub as an option for indie developers is an awesome solution. For those
    that require private repos, the fee isn't a stumbling block either.
