- en: MySQL is one of the most popular database platforms, very widely used for powering
    database-driven websites on the Internet and often used by web applications programmed
    in PHP. MySQL offers features, such as high performance, ease-of-use, and easy
    installation, yet a very efficient security mechanism. However, prior to Version
    5.5, the fact that the default installation of MySQL came with a user named **root**
    with no password, presents a rather worrying security vulnerability.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: While MySQL 5.5 and later versions require some basic configuration that includes
    certain security measures with no limitation to setting a password for the **root**
    user right after installation, a preliminary action must be taken after a fresh
    installation of MySQL 5.1, by setting a password for the **root** user as early
    as possible. Navicat does not only make it very easy to make such configurations
    easy to manage, but it also provides a few useful tools for security management
    and database maintenance.

    notice a different button with a lock icon titled **Privilege Manager**. The **Privilege
    Manager** button was introduced in Navicat as of Version 10, and it is like a
    command central, where you can manage all users for all schemas, and a matrix
    of all privileges for an entire server, or for specific catalogs (databases) from
    within a single window.

    setting up your first connection to a MySQL server, you also defined the settings
    for the **root** user. The root user is always listed in the object pane when
    you switch to the **User** view (unless deleted for a specific reason of course,
    and which should be a good one, I might add). An `@` symbol is added as a suffix
    to the username, which is proceeded by the name of the server that the user is
    permitted to connect from; in this case, the server name is `localhost`. If you
    want the **root** user to connect from remote machines, then you must add another
    user with the same name; in this case the username is **root**, but specify the
    domain name or the IP address of that remote machine in the field labeled **Host
    Name**. For example, you could see `myuser@workpc`.
