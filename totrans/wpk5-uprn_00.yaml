- en: When I was asked to write this training book, I realized that very little was
    known about webpack and its purpose. It is generally something a developer stumbles
    upon and learns on the job, which can be a very laborious process. There is some
    documentation on the Webpack.js website as well as a handful of credible resources
    such as Medium. However, these resources do tend to speak to the reader from the
    point of view of an expert and I, for one, found this not to be ideal.

    how very skilled and intelligent people can have blind spots and knowledge gaps.
    As a lecturer, I was advised, and also relay the message on, that *there are no
    wrong questions*. Many people who have not come from a teaching background might
    suggest they don't want to speak down to you and would prefer you not ask the
    wrong questions. We have found this is harmful if a student would rather remain
    silent over asking questions.

    words such as "bespoke", nonetheless, the premise is that all of us have head-slapping
    moments, where we should have done something, and later on realize what we did
    wrong. Am I right? Well, it happens to the most brilliant of us. Also, most instructors
    may be reluctant to talk you through something to the nth degree for fear of patronizing
    you. The problem being is that there will always be some mundane detail, that
    the developer thought obvious but could be interpreted more than one way. When
    I lectured the rule was: "there are no stupid questions", so I hope to prove the
    necessity of that theory.'

    5*, will introduce you to Webpack—specifically, Webpack version 5\. It will include
    an overview of the central concepts around Webpack and how it is used.'

    and Code Splitting*, will elaborate on modules and code splitting, as well as
    some of the more salient and interesting aspects of Webpack 5 that are key to
    understanding Webpack.'

    and Options*, will look at the world of configuration, understanding its limitations
    and capabilities as well as where options can play their part.'

    Loaders*, will pry into the world of APIs, loaders, and plugins. These features
    of Webpack expound the capabilities of the platform, springboarding from configurations
    and options.'

- en: '[Chapter 5](9c9c4faf-96a0-43b2-bcc8-8b72ec1b7ee5.xhtml), *Libraries and Frameworks*,
    will discuss libraries and frameworks. Our examination of plugins, APIs, and loaders
    has revealed that sometimes, we don''t want to use remote code such as libraries,
    but other times we do. Webpack generally deals with locally hosted code, but there
    are times when we might want to work with libraries. This provides a good transition
    to that topic.'

    and Live Coding Hacks*, will show you working examples of very simple, easy-to-apply,
    but bespoke practical lessons in Webpack 5, specifically Webpack 5 over earlier
    versions. There will be vanilla JavaScript tutorials as well as common frameworks,
    Vue.js will be a good one.'
