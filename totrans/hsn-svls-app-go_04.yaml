    Go. We also learned how to invoke it manually from the console. To leverage the
    power of Lambda, in this chapter, we are going to learn how to trigger this Lambda
    function in response to incoming HTTP requests (event-driven architecture) using
    the AWS API Gateway service. At the end of this chapter, you will be familiar
    with API Gateway advanced topics such as resources, deployment stages, debugging,
    and much more.

- en: API Gateway is an AWS serverless API proxy service that allows you to create
    a single and unified entry point for all of your Lambda functions. It proxies
    and routes the incoming HTTP requests to the appropriate Lambda function (mapping).
    From a server-side perspective, it's a facade or a wrapper that sits on top of
    Lambda functions. However, from a client's perspective, it's just a single monolithic
    application.

    happen?  It's simple. If you remember from [Chapter 1](746d14b6-7349-4f9e-b76f-f56706e1d0d5.xhtml), *Go
    Serverless*, the Lambda functions are stateless. When the `InsertMovie` function
    is invoked for the first time (first insert), AWS Lambda creates a container and
    deploys the function payload to the container. Then, it remains active for a few
    minutes before it is terminated (**warm start**), which explains why the second insert
    passed. In the third insert, the container is already terminated, and hence Lambda
    creates a new container (**cold start**) to handle the insert.

    make any assumptions that the state will be preserved from one invocation to the
    next. So, how can we manage data persistency when working with serverless applications?
    The answer is by using an external database like DynamoDB, which will be the subject
    of the upcoming chapter.

    and API Gateway. We also covered how to debug and troubleshoot incoming API Gateway
    requests by enabling the CloudWatch logs feature, plus how to create an API deployment
    stage and how to create multiple endpoints with different HTTP methods. Finally,
    we learned about the cold/warm container issue and why Lambda functions should
    be stateless.
