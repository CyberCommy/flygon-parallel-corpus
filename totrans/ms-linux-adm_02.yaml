- en: Linux permissions and access control are crucial aspects of the Linux operating
    system that help secure files, directories, and system resources. They ensure
    that only authorized users and processes can access or modify certain files and
    directories. Linux uses a combination of permissions and ownership to control
    access to files and directories.

    has special permissions that allow them to control access to the file, including
    changing permissions and modifying ownership. The owner can also assign a specific
    group to the file.
