- en: Docker and its ecosystem are evolving at a very high pace, so it is very important
    to understand the basics and build group up to adopt to new concepts and tools.
    With step-by-step instructions to practical and applicable recipes, *Docker Cookbook*
    will not only help you with the current version of Docker (1.6), but with the
    accompanying text it, will provide you with conceptual information to cope up
    with the minor changes in the new versions of Docker. To know more about the book,

- en: The recipes in this cookbook will definitely run on Fedora 21-installed physical
    machines or VMs, as I used that configuration as the primary environment. As Docker
    can run on many platforms and distributions, you should be able to run most of
    the recipes without any problem. For a few recipes, you will also need Vagrant
    ([https://www.vagrantup.com/](https://www.vagrantup.com/)) and Oracle Virtual
    Box ([https://www.virtualbox.org/](https://www.virtualbox.org/)).
