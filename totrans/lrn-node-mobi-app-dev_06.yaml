- en: Ionic is a free and open source library of mobile-optimized HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
    components, gestures, and tools that can be used to build highly interactive mobile
    apps. Being built around the widely used **Syntactically Awesome Stylesheets**
    (**Sass**) and AngularJS technologies, Ionic offers web developers with a basic
    knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript an opportunity to develop cross-platform
    mobile applications.

    Your Workspace*, we highlighted the basic essentials of setting up your workspace
    for Ionic, which included an installation of the core Ionic libraries as well
    as the Android and iOS SDKs.

    which is the web service that allows us to easily deploy and test our creations
    on Android and iOS devices through the Ionic View application. Through the Ionic
    web service, we will also be able to configure capabilities such as push notifications,
    which are an excellent way of interacting with your application's audience.
