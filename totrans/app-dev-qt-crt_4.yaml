- en: Localization is an important, yet commonly neglected part of software development
    today. Most authors of applications, whether those applications are commercial
    or open source, have hopes to capture a large number of users for their application.
    Increasingly, this means supporting multiple languages in multiple locales; often
    needing support for multiple languages in one locale (think of French and English
    co-existing in Canada).

- en: Qt has long had a framework for making applications easy to localize. With tools
    that help you avoid hardcoding strings in your application and a GUI named Qt
    Linguist to help manage translation, Qt eases the burden of localization throughout
    your application development cycle. In this chapter, we will look at Qt's strategy
    for localization, discussing the three tools (**lupdate**, **lrelease**, and **Qt
    Linguist**) Qt provides and how to use them, along with what you need to do as
    you write your application to take advantage of Qt's localization framework.

    application is nearly done before submitting the application strings for localization.
    Larger applications, or larger companies with a dedicated staff of translators,
    may prefer a more iterative approach, going through the localization cycle several
    times throughout application development. Qt supports both the models.

    Qt Creator"), *Getting Started with Qt Creator*, I told you to always mark your
    strings for localization using the `tr` and `qsTr` functions: `tr` for C++ and
    `qsTr` for QML strings. Doing so has two key advantages for you. First, it enables
    Qt to find every string that needs localization. Second, if you install a Qt translator
    object in your application and provide a translation file, the strings you wrap
    with these functions are automatically replaced by their localized equivalent.'

    table of those strings for Qt Linguist to localize. You can do this using the
    `lupdate` command, which takes your `.pro` file and walks your sources looking
    for strings to localize, and creates an XML file for Qt Linguist of the strings
    you need to translate. You'll do this once for each language you want to support.
    When doing this, it's best to name the resulting files systematically; one way
    to do that is to use the name of the project file, followed by a dash, followed

- en: Localizing applications with Qt is easy using Qt Linguist and the localization
    framework in Qt. To use the framework, though, you must mark your strings to localize
    with `tr` or `qsTr` in your source code wherever they appear. Once you do so,
    you can create a source file of strings to translate with Qt Linguist using Qt's
    `lupdate` command, and then provide translations for each string. Once you've
    provided the translations, you compile them using `lrelease`, and then include
    them in your application by installing a `QTranslator` object in your application's
    `main` function and loading the translation table generated by `lrelease`.
