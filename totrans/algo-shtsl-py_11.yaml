    be around 5%. Humans in general, and clients in particular, vastly overestimate
    their tolerance for pain. Besides, it will take time and effort to redress the
    situation. The upper bound is literally a business decision. Volatility is a by-product
    of risk—the more risk you tolerate at the portfolio level, the more volatility
    you invite in the portfolio. This will in turn limit the type of clientele you
    will be able to target. Pension funds are volatility-adverse, for instance. It

    take a classic case. Someone up there in the rarefied atmosphere of management
    hits pause on a Solitaire game and decides to reduce exposure across the board.
    In execution trader English, this means cutting leverage. There is no cookie-cutter
    formula to shave position size across a portfolio. There are several methods available
    to market participants. They range from axing all positions across the board to
    surgically excising marginal risk out of the most vulnerable positions. Since
    anyone can do the former, let's explore how the latter can be done with minimal
    effort.

- en: 'Hypothetically, we will aim to reduce open risk from -4.8% to -2.8%. Since
    open risk is evenly distributed, we will shave -1% off risk on each side. The
    code works for dissociated risk reduction, but this will keep it simple. The logic
    is to reduce the size, starting by using relative risk (`rRisk`) as a sorting
    key: `port_long[''rRisk''] / (port_long[''rRisk''].sum()`. The higher the risk,
    the bigger the reduction, and so on.'

    / (port_long['rRisk'].sum()`. 风险越高，减少越大，依此类推。

    rustic but it works. In our example, stop losses have not been reset and all positions
    miraculously contribute. As Groucho Marx once said: "No man goes before his time, unless
    the boss leaves early." So, we will still have to cut exposure.'

    net exposure is to sell futures, which have lower beta than single stocks. Both
    techniques have a material impact on correlation and volatility. But, net exposure
    is to portfolio management what price-to-earnings ratio is to valuations. It is
    a good enough shortcut, but it should not be the sole basis for a decision. It
    is better to contextualize net exposure along with other variables. It is therefore
    important to go past the net exposure headline figure and look at the composition
    of the portfolio through net beta.

    cap, exchange, and liquidity sides. With small caps at 1.7 and beyond on the long
    side, agonizing shorts at 0.8, and futures at 1 on the short side, our net beta

- en: Beta is a central concept of the relative long/short business. Beta is the sensitivity
    to the markets. If the market returns $1, a beta of 1.5 would return $1.5\. In
    mathematical terms, this is the slope of the return of a stock versus the benchmark.
    Net beta is the difference between the beta adjusted long and short exposures
    expressed as a decimal value. It goes past the net exposure headline to reflect
    a portfolio's underlying directional sensitivity. When risk is on and Mr. Market
    is in a good mood, high beta stocks tend to do well. The market rewards risk takers
    who go for riskier issues. Liquidity is the primary risk of any market. As a result,
    small caps have higher beta than large caps. High beta stocks are also industries
    where there are significant failure risks such as tech or biotech, or balance
    sheet risks such as financials. Critics of the hedge fund industry often describe
    hedge funds as beta merchants, or beta disguised as alpha. Critics are right.
    A relative long/short portfolio is by definition an arbitrage on beta. Similarly,
    a painter is someone who throws pigments at a blank canvas.

    would be constituted of stocks that return less than the market, or beta below
    1\. This can result in net exposure hovering around +20% but net beta firmly at
    +0.5\. Headline net exposure may appear low, but residual sensitivity to the markets
    can be elevated. In a bear market, the long book would be constituted of defensive
    issues such as foods and utilities with a beta traditionally below 1\. The short
    book would list all the leaders of the previous bull phase disgorging their euphoria.
    This would result in a positive net exposure of somewhere between +5 to +20% and
    a negative net beta of -0.1 to -0.5\. Bearish portfolios have defensive stocks
    on the long side and market-sensitive stocks on the short side.

- en: The way to sustainably attract and retain investors is to have structurally
    more names on the short than the long side, or net negative concentration. Portfolios
    often have more names on the long side than the short. When confronted with the
    scarcity of ideas on the short side, market participants resort to oversizing
    their short bets to bring net exposure down. They end up rationalizing these decisions
    by calling their outsized positions "high-conviction shorts," "structural shorts,"
    or "tactical shorts."

    side is notoriously volatile, this results in the short book driving the volatility
    of the overall portfolio. Now, investors want low volatility. The only way to
    lower volatility is to reduce the concentration on the short side. This means
    smaller bets and more diversified names. As we saw in *Chapter 5*, *Regime Definition*,
    this is feasible in a relative long/short portfolio but much harder to accomplish
    in an absolute long/short. The short book needs to have structurally more names
    than the long side to compensate for the volatility.

    to drive the volatility of their entire portfolios. Low tracking errors are correlated
    with the stability of AUM. In execution trader English, this means that you will
    be heralded as a "stock picker" when things work but branded as a high tracking
    error risk when your style falls out of favor. This is the institutional investor

    positions. This is endemic on the short side. On the long side, even bets as small
    as 0.50% can expand into formidable positions. Back in August 1997, Bill Gates
    bought a $2 million stake in a moribund penny stock at $12 named AAPL. However,
    on the short side, successful trades shrink. Even if a stock went down 10%, a
    -0.50% initial bet would only return +0.05%. Add transaction costs and slippage
    and there is barely enough money left for coffee and croissants. On the short
    side, keep powder until the fat pitch shows up. Market participants are all too
    often scared to sell short. They respond by taking positions too small to hurt
    but also too tiny to contribute. So, work on your risk management first, then
    execute your strategy. Here is some advice that is as old as the Jedi master who

    goals may be lofty. They are still rooted in reality. The next step is to articulate
    your objectives into a portfolio management process. Go back to the transmission
    part and focus on the variables. What is your position sizing algorithm? Define
    your portfolio using the four main exposures in your toolbox: gross, net, net
    beta, concentration. Those will determine correlation, volatility, drawdowns,
    and ultimately performance.'

    is difficult to simulate. For example, some strategies have only a few trades
    a year. If you missed a trade because you did not have enough cash on hand to
    buy a security that went on to outperform by 20%, your entire results would be
    skewed. There is no easy way around this issue. These back-testing issues are
    beyond the immediate scope of this book.

    check. Are your objectives attainable? By now, you should have a reasonable idea
    of the box you could fit in. For example, you probably understand that +30% returns
    with net exposure at +/-5% and gross at 200% are highly improbable. You also know that
    by reducing volatility in half, you would jump the queue.

    We trade our emotions. This manifests both in over/under trading as well as position

    an off-road spin. In this chapter, we looked at the major levers to engineer the
    returns you need to attract the clientele you want. Those are gross exposure or
    leverage, portfolio heat or open risk, net exposure or directionality, net beta
    or residual sensitivity to the market, and concentration or the net number of
    names in the portfolio. Those variables give access to volatility, performance,
    correlation, and liquidity as in market impact.
