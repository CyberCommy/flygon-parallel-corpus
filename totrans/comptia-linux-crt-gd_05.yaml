- en: In the previous chapter, we looked at preparing the hard disk for use. We worked
    with the `fdisk` and `parted` utilities. We saw the steps to create and remove
    a partition. We also saw how we could resize a partition. We then turned our focus
    to formatting a partition for use. We looked at the various filesystems available
    on today's Linux distributions. After that, we took a look at how to mount a partition
    to be able to start storing data. We then looked at unmounting a partition. Finally,
    we created entries in the `/etc/fstab` file to have our mount point(s) load upon
    system boot. In this chapter, our focus now is on the actual installation of a
    Linux distribution, the process involved with booting into a LiveCD, when installing
    Linux from scratch. Then, we will focus on installing Linux side by side with
    a Windows OS. Finally, we will look at installing Linux side by side with another
    Linux distribution.

    a Linux distribution. Instead of us wiping our hard drive(s), we can install Linux
    using what is known as a LiveCD. Keep in mind, the experience may seem as though
    we are installing a Linux distribution, but in fact we are actually temporarily
    loading up files into RAM, and the LiveCD is acting as though it is installed
    on an actual hard drive. That is the main concept of a LiveCD.

- en: In this chapter, we certainly dived deep into the installations of Linux Distributions.
    We covered the concept of a LiveCD. We discussed the scenarios for using a LiveCD;
    namely, when we want to test, when we have hardware resources, or are performing
    some administrative tasks. We then did a demo of using a LiveCD. Keeping in mind
    that the actual Linux distribution is running from a medium other than the hard
    disk. It does this by loading some files into RAM. A distinct advantage that the
    LiveCD offers is the fact that it does not interfere with your underlying operating
    system. We then switched our attention to doing a fresh installation of a Linux
    distribution. The steps involved in performing a fresh installation vary between
    distributions. After that, we focused on doing a dual boot between Windows and
    Linux, particularly Windows 10 and Ubuntu. Finally, we finished off this chapter
    by doing a dual boot between Linux distributions, particularly CentOS and Ubuntu.
