- en: Most data analysts use Python and pandas for data processing and manipulation
    thanks to the convenience and performance that these libraries provide. However,
    JavaScript developers have always wanted **machine learning** (**ML**) to be possible
    in the browser as well. This book focuses on how Danfo.js brings data processing,
    analysis, and ML tools to JavaScript developers and how you can make the most
    of this library to develop data-driven applications.

- en: The book starts with an introduction to JavaScript concepts and modern JavaScript.
    You'll then cover data analysis and transformation with Danfo.js and Dnotebook,
    which is an interactive computing environment for JavaScript. After that, the
    book covers how to load different types of datasets and analyze them by performing
    operations such as handling missing values, combining datasets, and string manipulations.
    You'll also focus on data plotting, visualization, data aggregation, and group
    operations by combining Danfo.js with Plotly. Later, you'll create a no-code data
    analysis and handling system with the help of Danfo.js. Then, you'll be introduced
    to basic ML concepts and how to use Tensorflow.js and Danfo.js to build a recommendation
    system. Finally, you'll build a Twitter analytics dashboard powered by Danfo.js.

    and ML capabilities into any JavaScript app in server-side Node.js or the browser.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book is for data science beginners, data analysts, and JavaScript developers
    who want to explore each stage of data analysis and scientific computing using
    a wide range of datasets. You'll also find this book useful if you are a data
    analyst, data scientist, or JavaScript developer looking to implement Danfo.js
    in your ML workflow. A working understanding of the JavaScript programming language,
    data science, and ML will assist you in understanding the key concepts covered
    in this book; however, an introductory JavaScript section has been provided in
    the first chapter and the appendix of the book.

    JavaScript*, discusses ECMA 6 syntax and the use of `import` statements, class
    methods, `extend` methods, and constructors. It also goes deep into an explanation
    of the `Promise` method, the use of `async` and `await` functions, and the `fetch`
    method. It also introduces how to set up an environment that supports modern JavaScript
    syntax, and proper versioning, as well as covering how to write unit tests.'
