- en: Greetings! If you have picked up this book, chances are you are interested in
    developing games on Android devices using UE4\. This book explains all that you
    need to know in order to get started using UE4\. From the very basics, such as
    downloading and installing the software, to the more advanced, such as packaging
    your finished game and porting it onto your android device, everything will be
    covered in this guide. You can develop games for a wide variety of platforms on
    UE4, but the one we will be focusing on is Android.

- en: Learning how to use a game engine can be a daunting task; you just do not know
    where to begin, and UE4 is no exception. However, once you get the hang of it,
    you will quickly find out how extremely powerful and intuitive it really is. And
    what better to teach you how to use a game engine than by actually making a game
    in it? This book will teach you all that you need to know for you to be able to
    develop games on Android platforms using UE4, and make an actual functional game
    in the process. The reason behind this is simple; just talking about the features
    offered by UE4 and demonstrating them one at a time is not very effective when
    learning how to develop a game. However, if one were to explain those very features
    by implementing them in a game, it would be much more effective, since you would
    get a better understanding of how each feature affects the game and each other.

    a first person puzzle game, wherein the main objective of the player is to solve
    a series of puzzles in order to progress. As the player progresses, the puzzles
    get progressively more complex and complicated to solve. As for the scope of the
    game, it will contain four rooms, each with a puzzle that the player has to solve
    in order to progress to the next room.

    systems, in terms of scripting, and level design. To put it in the context of
    the guide, things such as scripting with blueprints and level design will be much
    better demonstrated through a puzzle game. Although the game will be explained
    thoroughly in the subsequent chapters, a high-level breakdown of the game''s features
    are as follows:'

    up-to-date with the latest developments and news, and keep interacting with the

    (4.1, 4.2, 4.3, and so on) work independent of each other. This means you do not
    require the previous version to run the later versions. For example, if you wish
    to run version 4.4, then you do not need to download versions 4.0, 4.1, 4.2, and
    4.3 in order to run it. You can simply download version 4.4 and use it without
    any problems. This is the reason why there is a separate folder for every version
    of Unreal 4, each version is treated like a separate entity.

    project file, the Launcher will launch the version 4.0 of UE4\. If, however, you
    do not have the corresponding version, then upon launching the project, you will
    be asked to select which installed version you wish to launch the project file
    in. After you have made your choice, it will then convert the project to be compatible
    with the version you selected and launch it. However, always be careful when converting
    a project, as some unexpected issues might occur. It is advisable to create a
    backup copy of the project before you convert it.

- en: The preceding screenshot demonstrates what **Vault** looks like and how the
    items are arranged. On the left is the thumbnail of the item, followed by the
    name of said item. Below the name is the amount of space occupied by that item.
    The blue **i** icon below the name is information regarding compatibility. Hovering
    the cursor over **i** will show you which versions of UE4 that item is compatible
    with.

    similar to **My Projects**. Let's look at the first item in the Vault as an example,
    that is, the Animation Starter Pack. On the thumbnail, **4.4-4.6** is written.
    This means that the Animation Starter Pack is compatible with versions 4.4, 4.5,
    and 4.6.

    while others have the **Create Project** option. Items such as animation packs,
    assets, materials, and audio files can be added to any project you have already
    created, and you can use them in your level. Projects and Showcases have the **Create
    Project** option. Once you click on it, it will create a project and will be displayed
    in **My Projects**, from where you can open it. Additionally, you can verify or
    remove any item by clicking on the downward arrow, and clicking on the corresponding
    option from the drop-down menu.

    to discuss. There is the Development Discussion section, where you can talk about
    Blueprints, Animation, Rendering, C++ Gameplay Programming, and so on. Then, there
    is the Community section where you can showcase your work in progress and get
    feedback, and also see other people's work and give them feedback. Following that
    is the UE4 for Schools section, which is dedicated to students and teachers to
    discuss UE4 and the education program. Finally, there is the International section,
    where you can interact with developers from your demographic. Recruiting and teaming
    up with people for a project is easier and much more convenient since almost all
    of the members are from the same general area.

    can resolve any issues, technical or otherwise, with the help of the UE4 community
    or from the Epic staff. To do so, simply login, post your question, and wait for
