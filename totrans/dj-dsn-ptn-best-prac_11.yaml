    Deploying this application can involve a diverse set of activities from choosing
    your hosting provider to performing installations. Even more challenging could

    it is worthwhile to clarify what it really means. A production environment is
    simply one where end users use your application. It should be available, resilient,
    secure, responsive, and must have abundant capacity for current (and future) needs.

- en: Unlike a development environment, the chance of real business damage due to
    any issues in a production environment is high. Hence, before moving to production,
    the code is moved to various testing and acceptance environments in order to get
    rid of as many bugs as possible. For easy traceability, every change made to the
    production environment must be tracked, documented, and made accessible to everyone
    in the team.

    environment. In fact, there is no need to install development tools, such as a
    compiler or debugger in production. The presence of any additional software increases
    the attack surface of your site and could pose a security risk.

    large data centers running 24/7/365\. By designing for failure, even if an internal
    component fails, there is enough redundancy to prevent the entire system crashing.
    This concept of avoiding a **single point of** **failure** (**SPOF**) can be applied
    at every level—hardware or software.

    on. Even though we are talking about it at the very end, it is best not to postpone
    such decisions to the later stages of the application lifecycle. Ideally, your
    development environment must be as close as possible to the production environment
    to avoid the "but it works on my machine" argument.

    Different components have different strengths and weaknesses. Choose them only

  zh: 这些托管平台的底线是它们非常容易设置，非常适合较小的项目。随着用户群体的增长，它们往往会变得更加昂贵。
- en: Another downside is that your application might get tied to a platform or become
    difficult to port. For instance, Google App Engine is used to support only a non-relational
    database, which means you need to use `django-nonrel`, a fork of Django. This
    limitation is now somewhat mitigated with Google Cloud SQL.

  zh: 另一个缺点是，你的应用程序可能会与某个平台绑定，或者变得难以移植。例如，Google App Engine 只支持非关系型数据库，这意味着你需要使用 `django-nonrel`，这是

    environment. From the developer's perspective, it would seem like a dedicated
    machine (hence, the word private) preloaded with an operating system. You will
    need to install and set up the entire stack yourself, though many VPS providers
    such as WebFaction and DigitalOcean offer easier Django setups.

  zh: 虚拟专用服务器（VPS）是在共享环境中托管的虚拟机。从开发者的角度来看，它看起来像是一个预装有操作系统的专用机器（因此称为私有）。你需要自己安装和设置整个堆栈，尽管许多
    VPS 提供商，比如 WebFaction 和 DigitalOcean，提供了更简单的 Django 设置。
- en: If you are a beginner and can spare some time, I highly recommend this approach.
    You would be given root access, and you can build the entire stack yourself. You

- en: On the lighter end of the hosting spectrum, you can save the cost by hosting
    multiple applications within Docker containers. Docker is a tool to package your
    application and dependencies in a virtual container. Compared to traditional virtual
    machines, a Docker container starts up faster and has minimal overheads (since
    there is no bundled operating system or hypervisor).
  id: totrans-46

  zh: 在托管光谱的较轻端，您可以通过在Docker容器中托管多个应用程序来节省成本。Docker是一种将应用程序和依赖项打包到虚拟容器中的工具。与传统虚拟机相比，Docker容器启动更快，开销更小（因为没有捆绑的操作系统或hypervisor）。
- en: Docker is ideal for hosting micro services-based applications. It is becoming
    as ubiquitous as virtualization with almost every PaaS and VPS provider supporting
    them. It is also a great development platform since Docker containers encapsulate
    the entire application state and can be directly deployed to production.

    the Facebook team can release code to production up to twice a day. Considering

- en: The key strength of Fabric is its ability to run commands on a set of remote
    hosts. For instance, you can define a `web` group that contains the hostnames
    of all web servers in production. You can run a Fabric action only against these
    web servers by specifying the web group name on the command line.

    template fragment gets cached.'

    caches get invalidated. Notice that we first invalidate the cache content directly

    The dependencies between models need to be tracked for this pattern to work.
  id: totrans-136

    the user might get served stale data from the cache. However, an asynchronous

    periodically warm the cache at a certain interval to refresh the content.

    parts of a site. For many sites, the dynamic parts are the user-specific data
