    in this book, you'll learn how to build a fully functional blockchain from scratch
    using the JavaScript programming language. The blockchain that you build will
    have functionalities that are similar to those you would find in a production-level
    blockchain for examples such as Bitcoin or Ethereum.

    by learning to build your own blockchain and understanding the decentralized network.
    Toward the conclusion of the book, you will have a full-fledged blockchain prototype
    that is hosted on a decentralized network, and you'll have gained a great deal
    of knowledge and understanding as to how blockchains actually work under the hood.

    actually is. This will help you to become familiar with the concept of blockchain,
    as this is a prerequisite for the book. Then we'll move on to learn how to set
    up the project to create our own blockchain.

- en: In this section, let's go through a brief explanation of what a blockchain is.
    Simply put, a **blockchain** is an immutable, distributed ledger. Now, these words
    may seem quite complex, but when we try to break them down, it is very easy to
    understand them. Let's begin by exploring what a ledger actually is. A ledger
    is simply a collection of financial accounts or transactions (or in other words,
    a record of transactions that people have made).

- en: 'Let''s take a look at the following example to get a better understanding of
    ledgers. In this example, Kim paid Joe $30 and Kevin paid Jen $80\. A ledger is
    simply a document that is used to keep track of these transactions. You can see
    this depicted in the following screenshot:'

- en: Now, what does it mean for a blockchain to be immutable? This means that it
    cannot be changed—ever. Consequently, when a transaction is recorded, it cannot
    be undone. Other factors that cannot be changed include the amount of money that
    was sent or the people who took part in the transaction.  Once a transaction is
    made, no aspects of that transaction can be changed because it is immutable.

    all centralized. Take Facebook, for example. Everyone who uses Facebook has to
    trust this company is protecting their data and not abusing it. Compared to this,
    blockchain is different. Blockchain technology is not centralized like Facebook,
    Google, or most other entities. Instead, it is a distributed network, which means
    that any given blockchain network is not controlled by a single entity, but is
    run by normal, everyday people. Blockchains, such as Bitcoin, are supported and
    hosted by thousands of people worldwide. Consequently, all of our data, or the
    ledger in this case, is not at the mercy of a single company or entity. This proves
    to be a great benefit of blockchain technology because by being distributed, we
    do not have to trust a single company with our data. Instead, our data is persisted
    by the entire network of thousands of different people who are all acting independently.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Each individual who contributes to the blockchain network is called a node,
    and each node has the exact same copy of the ledger. Therefore, the ledger data
    is hosted and synchronized across the entire network.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So, a blockchain is an immutable distributed ledger. This means that it is a
    ledger in which the transactions can never be changed and the blockchain itself
    is distributed across the network and run by thousands of independent people,
    groups, or nodes.

    but its future is very exciting. There are many ways that blockchain technology
    can be applied to our world today to make certain industries more secure, efficient,
    and trustworthy. Some industries that could be transformed with the help of blockchain
    technology include financial services, healthcare,  credit,  governments, energy
    industries, and many others. Pretty much every industry out there could benefit
    from a more secure, distributed form of data management.  You can observe that
    blockchain technology is at a very exciting stage right now, and many people are
    excited about what the future holds for it.

    by building your own blockchain from scratch. Blockchain is a fairly new technology,
    and while it can seem tough and slightly overwhelming to learn at first, we're
    going to take a step-by-step approach and break it down in order to understand
    how it works under the hood. By the time you finish this book, you will have a
    very solid understanding of how blockchain technology works, and you will have
    built your own entire blockchain as well.

    all of the functionality that we have built into our blockchain data structure.

    that we'll have multiple servers running and acting as separate nodes. We'll also
    make sure that all of the nodes interact with each other properly and share data
    with each other in the correct format. In addition, you'll learn how to synchronize
    the entire network by making sure that any new nodes or transactions that are created
    are broadcast throughout the entire network.

    used to make sure that our entire blockchain stays synchronized and that this
    algorithm will be used to make sure that each node in our network has the correct
    blockchain data.
