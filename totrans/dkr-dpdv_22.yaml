    and Docker for Windows make it easy to play and develop with Docker on your laptop.
    [Play with Docker](https://play-with-docker.com/) is a free-to-use online playground
    where you can practice with Docker until you’re a world authority!

    If you’re not a member of Pluralsight then become one! Yes, it costs money, but
    it’s worth it! And if you’re unsure… they always have a free trial where you can
    get free access to my courses for a limited period.

    that it inspires you and opens new opportunities. If you’ve enjoyed it, show it
    some love with a few stars and a review on Amazon!
