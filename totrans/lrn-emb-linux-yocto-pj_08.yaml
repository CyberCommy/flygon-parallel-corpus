- en: In this chapter, you will be introduced to new tools and components used in
    the Yocto community. As the title suggests, this chapter is dedicated to another
    category of tools. I will start with **Hob** as a graphical interface, which is
    slowly dying, and in time, will be replaced by a new web interface called **Toaster**.
    A new point of discussion will also be introduced in this chapter. Here, I am
    referring to the QA and testing component that is, in most cases, absent or lacking
    from most of the projects. Yocto takes this problem very seriously and offers
    a solution for it. This solution will be presented in the last section of the
    chapter.

    Hob, Toaster, and Autobuilder. Each of these components will be assessed separately
    and their benefits and use cases are looked at in detail. For the first two components,
    (that is, Hob and Toaster) information regarding the build process is offered
    alongside the various setup scenarios. Hob is similar to BitBake and is tightly
    integrated with Poky and the Build Directory. Toaster, on the other hand, is a
    looser alternative that offers multiple configuration alternatives and setups,
    and a performance section that can be very useful for any developer interested
    in improving the build system's overall performance. The chapter ends with section
    on Autobuilder. This project is the cornerstone of the Yocto project that is dedicated
    to making embedded development and open source more user-friendly, in general,
    but also offers more secure and error-free projects. I hope that you enjoy this
    chapter; let's proceed to the first section.

- en: The Hob project represents a GUI alternative to the BitBake build system. Its
    purpose is to execute the most common tasks in an easier and faster manner, but
    it does not make command-line interactions go away. This is because most parts
    of recipes and configurations still need to be done manually. In the previous
    chapter, the BitBake Commander extension was introduced as an alternative solution
    for the editing of recipes, but in this project, it has its limitations.

    for users. Of course, there are users who do not prefer the graphical user interface
    alternatives to command-line options, and I kind of agree with them, but this
    is another discussion altogether. Hob can be an option for them also; it is an
    alternative not only for people who prefer having an interface in front of them,
    but also for those who are attached to their command-line interaction.

    an image, modifying its existing recipes, running an image through a QEMU emulator,
    or even deploying it on a USB device for some live-booting operations on a target
    device. Having all these functionalities is not much, but is a lot of fun. Your
    experience with the tools in Yocto Project do not matter here. The previously
    mentioned tasks can be done very easily and in an intuitive manner, and this is
    the most interesting thing about Hob. It offers its users what they need in a
    very easy fashion. People who interact with it can learn from the lessons it has
    to offer, whether they're graphic interface enthusiasts or command-line savvy.

    can do this by selecting them in the **Layers** window. The first thing to do
    for the `meta-atmel` layer is to add it to the build. Although you may start work
    in an already existing build directory, Hob will not be able to retrieve the existing
    configurations and will create a new one over the `bblayers.conf` and `local.conf`
    configuration files. It will mark the added lines using the next `#added by hob`

- en: The only explanation is the fact the `meta-atmel` layer does not update its
    recipes but appends them. This can be overcome in two ways. The simplest one would
    be to update the recipe the `.bbappend` file and make sure that the new available
    recipe is transformed into a patch for the upstream community. A patch with the
    required changes inside the `meta-atmel` layer will be explained to you shortly,
    but first, I will present the available options and the necessary changes that
    are needed to resolve the problems existing in the build process.
  id: totrans-24

- en: The other solution would be to include the required recipes that `meta-atmel`
    needs for the build process. The best place for it to be available would be also
    in `meta-atmel`. However, in this case, the `.bbappend` configuration file should
    be merged with the recipe, since having a recipe and its appended file in the
    same place does not make much sense.

    in general. Here, I am referring to the testing and quality assurance of a development
    process. This is, in fact, an area that requires more attention from us, including
    me as well. The Yocto Project through the AutoBuilder initiative tries to bring
    more attention to this area. Also, in the past few years, there has been a shift
    toward QA and **Continuous Integration** (**CI**) of available open source projects,
    and this can primarily be seen in the Linux Foundation umbrella projects.

- en: In this chapter, you were presented with a new set of components that are available
    in the Yocto Project. Here, I am referring to the Hob, Toaster, and AutoBuilder
    projects. The chapter first introduced Hob as a BitBake alternative. It was followed
    by the Toaster alternative to Hob, which also comes with a lot of interesting
    features, and although it is not at its best now, over time, it will become a
    real solution for developers who are not interested in learning a new technology.
    Instead, they only interact with a tool to get what they want in a quick and easy
    manner. This chapter finished with the AutoBuilder project that offers a QA and
    testing platform for the Yocto Project community and can be transformed in a continuous
    integration tool.

  zh: 在本章中，您将了解到Yocto Project中提供的一组新组件。在这里，我指的是Hob、Toaster和AutoBuilder项目。本章首先介绍了Hob作为BitBake的替代方案。接着介绍了Toaster作为Hob的替代方案，它也具有许多有趣的功能，尽管现在还不是最好的，但随着时间的推移，它将成为开发人员的真正解决方案，他们不想学习新技术，而是只需与工具交互，以快速简便的方式获得他们想要的东西。本章最后介绍了AutoBuilder项目，为Yocto
    Project社区提供了一个质量保证和测试平台，并可以转变为一个持续集成工具。
- en: In the next chapter, some of the other tools will be presented, but this time,
    the focus will move a little towards the exterior of the community and also its
    small tools. We will also cover projects and tools, such as Swabber, a project
    that is continuously in a developing stage. We will also take a look at Wic, a
    little tool with great personality, and the new sensation from Linaro called LAVA.
    I hope you enjoy learning all of them.
