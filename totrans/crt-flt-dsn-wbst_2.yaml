    that you need focus on while designing are. It will also cover the importance
    of typography, alignment, and grid and layout to create better and more readable
    designs. Read on to learn all the things to keep in mind while designing in flat,
    and prepare yourself to start creating your own flat design projects.

    This look and style rose quickly among designers due to its simplicity while retaining
    a great impact. In this chapter, we will cover the restrictions and rules of flat
    design, what you should do and shouldn't do, as well as when to use flat design
    in your layouts.

    a room filled with furniture, tables, couches, rugs, pots, and plants. You have
    been in a room like that, and even though it feels cozy, it feels cramped and
    sometimes, with just a bit too much of things. Now imagine removing those tables,
    couches, and rugs and leaving just the bare essentials: one rug, one couch, and
    only one small useful table. The white walls will look clearer and bigger, and
    the room will feel clearer and more spacious. For a designer starting in flat
    design, such as yourself, this is roughly the same process that you need to go
    through, by removing all the extra images, details, and effects such as drop shadows
    and gradients, and just focusing on showing the message with a flat background
    and flat color.'

- en: Flat design is definitely a trend. It's one that is sticking for a long time
    though, and the reason for that is there's good learning and good interfaces coming
    out of it. It's really common for designers to follow trends and create their
    work based on the style that is currently being used more frequently. After all,
    inspiration comes daily from pretty much everywhere we look, and the Web is something
    that we're constantly using. New ideas and approaches from designers on layouts
    create new paradigms and design patterns, and as such, it's just natural that
    we, as designers, follow these patterns. This leads to a constant improvement
    of the layouts and new ideas for interfaces, and with flat it is exactly the same.
    It's a specific style that has a specific look. If you want to create a flat design,
    you should stick to these kind of rules, and in the end, just get the best out
    of the style and mix it with your own. These rules can be seen as limitations
    as well, but that, in design, is not always a bad thing.

    find yourself using on your own without forcing it. Even the most minimalistic
    websites don't usually go for a flat look, as flat has its specific look and certain
    *rules*.

- en: This happens because designers often detect flaws and problems on a design and
    try to overcome them with embellishments and workarounds. Text that doesn't read
    well over every image usually has a subtle drop shadow to make sure that there's
    a darker background to make the text contrast enough to always be readable. These
    are the challenges that the designer is faced with. These limitations make designing
    interesting, because by removing all these crutches, the designer finds himself
    or herself focusing only on what's important.

- en: In an academic context, when a student is given a design project, where they
    are allowed to design whatever they want and are also able to choose which medium
    to use as the style, it often ends up with worse results than a student who is
    given a specific theme and medium. For example, by knowing that you're designing
    a website for children's toys, you have your focus and objective. When you're
    allowed to do everything, it's hard to know exactly what you want to focus on.
    Limitations work great in project management, to make you focus your mind on the
    most important tasks as well on design. This lets you design the elements that
    are needed and focus on the style that is more adequate to the objective in mind.

    something that looks flat and doesn't use any of the usual effects that you'd
    normally find yourself being able to use. You need to follow a certain aesthetic;
    it has to be simple, it needs to have a lot of white space, and it has to look
    structured and organized. The space in which you put your content will have to
    be very well thought out, as it usually will be a smaller portion. If you have
    a big page with dozens of text blocks, you end up having a more cramped layout
    and won't be able to get that aesthetic look you were trying to aim for.

    the look fits the target and objective of the product. Not all websites or apps
    will benefit from using a flat aesthetic design. A flat design look is, indeed,
    really flexible and can be used in very different types of markets and targets,
    but always keep your objective in mind. Use flat only if it makes sense for the
    project in hand. Each project is different and how you want to convey the message
    in your website or interact with your users through your user interface varies
    from project to project.

    web apps, mobile apps, restaurants, and a lot of other different examples, but
    you need to ask yourself this question: is flat a good look for my website? If
    you''re creating a game website, such as a RPG, or promoting a premium and expensive
    product, such as a watch or a good wine, you''re probably better off skipping
    flat. The reason is that these are projects that will benefit a lot from textures
    and effects such as gradients and shadows, and allow the designer to create a
    more premium and subtle look. A game website, for instance, is made up of game
    images and futuristic or old elements, which are always associated with the game
    in question. Imagine how boring it would be if the World of Warcraft website is
    in a flat design. So, make sure that your project is adequate for a flat look
    and don''t just use the style regardless of the objective, as it will defeat the
    purpose and lose all impact.'

    your design is, indeed, flat. However, don''t think that flat is a dictatorship;
    you can always try to create a flat 3D look, which looks really great, and yes,
    shadows are allowed. Every designer tries to add and improve the style with their
    own ideas, and great icons come along the way. The use of shadows and lighting
    shouldn''t disrupt the flat look. So, start by designing as flat as possible,
    focusing on the important things that make flat design look great. The design
    includes the grid, the white space, the composition, and the typography; when
    you feel comfortable, try adding these new elements, as they look really good.
    There''s even a style of shadow, called **long shadow**, used with flat. This
    basically resembles a light close to the ground, creating a heavy and long shadow
    on the surface. This creates a cool looking effect. Have a look at the following

    especially to design flat iconography, thus achieving a very interesting effect
    using flat colors on these icons. These illustrations look great and are really
    a good complement to the flat look on your website (if they are indeed relevant
    to your product and target), but photos can (and should) also be used. Flat is
    not only about text and simple colors; it's about creating a layout where your
    photos and your content stands out, by bringing the focus of the user on the content
    instead of on the interface. This was something that often happened on skeuomorphic
    interfaces.

    photos of people, products, or environment to showcase their product in a real-life
    situation more easily. It is frequently said that a picture is worth a thousand
    words, so, use those pictures well to help you communicate your message. Photos
    can be very important in setting the mood and tone of the website; a flat design
    looks great over a picture, as it's a mix between the complex (image) and the
    simple (layout), which gives a great contrast between the two.

    to worry about alignment, safe margins, and spacing. This is because the grid

    undeniable for flat. Since flat designs tend to have less boxes and lines, the
    grid is extremely important to hold all the visual elements together to form a
    layout. Two elements aligned can give the viewer the perception of a block or
    a line, and these visual perceptions are built using this grid and by ensuring

- en: Typography is extremely important for a flat design layout. To go along the
    lines of simplicity and geometric shapes, sans-serif is the definite choice when
    working with typography in flat. There are a number of typefaces that are more
    commonly found and used in flat designs. These are chosen as typefaces with their
    characteristics in mind. These typefaces are usually geometrical; however, with
    the possibility of having subtle rounded corners, they are are often used in uppercase
    in titles. This usage of all uppercase letters in a word is also to create a more
    impactful look for the word, and this can also be achieved by heavier weights
    on a font. A great font should have a couple of different weights to be able to
    mix a light weight style with a bold or extrabold one, as this mix of two opposite
    weights looks good visually, in titles and in text blocks. It gives a greater
    focus on the title by creating this visual contrast. The following screenshot
    is an example of the Motiva Sans typeface having different weights. This typeface
    is available at [http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/niramekko/motiva-sans/](http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/niramekko/motiva-sans/).

    free to search for more that adapt to the style you're aiming at. Depending on
    what kind of font you get, you can get a more serious tone or a more cheerful
    one. Choose a font wisely for your project, as the font is one of the main things
    that is responsible for the look that you create in a website. Ideally, you should
    choose a maximum of two or three typefaces per website. The main one should be
    for the titles. This is the most detailed typeface and the one that will set a
    tone on typography. You should choose another one for the text blocks, which will
    be your body; this one should be neutral, and its only objective is to make the
    text readable and make it look in contrast with the titles. The possible third
    one should be a typeface that works well in uppercase and small sizes; this can
    be be used in captions, to describe images, or it can be attached to graphics.
    Choose your typefaces with care; compare and test them to make sure that they
    go well together. Always keep the medium you're using in mind, as a typeface designed
    for the screen won't probably work on print, and vice-versa.

    to use. This palette is made up of all the colors used in the website and should
    have one or two main colors and some extra neutral colors. For instance, in the
    case of patterntap.com (shown in the following screenshot), the main color is
    obviously that greenish yellow used in the header section, while black is used
    for the secondary menu at the top, and a very light gray is used for the background.
    Each color has its own function. Yellow is the main color associated with the
    brand, and black is a separator. There is a separate content neutral zone, and
    gray is the content area, where readability is more important. Define your own
    palette; try to use different shades of the main color, a lighter and a darker
    one; and test how it works in links, headings, and visual elements such as lines.
    An important thing to remember while creating a color palette is that you must
    avoid mixing colors that don't go well together. Also, remember to be coherent
    in using them. If a heading is light blue in one page, it should be like that
    in all pages.

    use a very dark gray instead of complete black. It will look a lot better. Try
    the same with white; instead of pure white, try to use a grayish or yellowish
    white. Tinting that color a bit gives the element, where it's applied, another
    look, just as if you were using a texture.
