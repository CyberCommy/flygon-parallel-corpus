- en: Arch Linux is an independently developed, general purpose GNU/Linux distribution,
    optimized for i686/x86-64 systems. The distribution is versatile enough to suit
    you in any role/need. It has been designed focusing on simplicity, code elegance,
    and "do-it-yourself" principles. The basic installation of Arch Linux is a very
    minimal base system. From the base system, everything can and will be configured
    by the user to suit their ideal environment, suited for their own unique purposes.
    The supported method of configuration is from the shell editing simple text files.
    Being a rolling-release distribution, there are no fixed releases. From time to
    time there are new install images provided by the Release Engineering Team, so
    that the installation media suits the new features introduced over time. Because
    of this rolling-release model, Arch Linux provides you with bleeding-edge software,
    typically the latest stable versions available. Pacman is the package manager
    of Arch Linux, which is designed to be an easy to use binary package manager.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Arch Linux was founded in 2002 by Judd Vinet who was inspired by the elegance
    and simplicity of some other Linux distributions such as Slackware, Polish Linux
    Distribution, and CRUX. But this simplicity came without a package manager, which
    was a big disappointment. Basically, to make his own life easier, Judd Vinet started
    Arch Linux with pacman as the package manager that can automatically handle the
    installation, upgrade, or removal of packages. Over the years Arch Linux kept
    on gaining more users, more developers, and has now been in the top 10 used distributions
    on DistroWatch for a pretty long time. Arch Linux is still being developed by
    volunteers and is not backed by some big company; the goal is to stay *free* in
    every sense of the word. In 2007 Judd Vinet passed the Project Lead to Aaron Griffin,
    who remains the Lead Arch Linux Developer to this day.

    summarized as being KISS (keep it simple stupid). There are five core principles
    defined in this core: philosophy, simplicity, code-correctness over convenience,
    user-centric, openness, and freedom.'

- en: '**Simplicity** is definitely the base objective for Arch development, with
    the idea that a lightweight base structure with high quality code will have lower
    system resource demands. The base system found in Arch Linux has no clutter that
    might hide parts of the system, or make it difficult to access parts of the system.
    All configuration files are simple, nicely documented, easy to read, and nicely
    arranged for quick editing. There are no special configuration tools that might
    hide possibilities from the user, which leads to a system configurable to the
    very last detail. The Arch Linux Developers believe that trying to hide the complexity
    of a system results in an even more complex system, and this should always be
    avoided.'

    or complications, and provides a lightweight UNIX-like base structure that allows
    an individual user to shape the system according to their own needs. In short:
    an elegant, minimalist approach.'

    not unneeded patching, automation, eye candy or "newbie-friendliness". Software
    patches are only introduced when needed. Packages found in Arch Linux are really
    the way the Developers created them, nothing more, nothing less.'

- en: Being **user-centric** means that the users fully manage the system on their
    own. The system will offer no, to little assistance. There is a simple set of
    maintenance tools that are simply relaying the commands given by the user. Arch
    Linux is founded on simple, sensible design, and excellent documentation. As a
    user, you need more of a "do-it-yourself" approach rather than asking the Developers
    to implement a new feature. Most Arch users have indeed the tendency to solve
    their problems and share them with the entire community, which also leads to a
    friendly and helpful community of developers and users.

    saying most Arch users share the solutions to the problems they have encountered.
    Also, the Arch Linux Developers strive for an open system, which goes hand in
    hand with simplicity. Openness is intended to make things simple. It also removes
    the abstraction of things, which might lead to a steeper learning curve, but in
    the end it leads to an easily controllable and maintainable system. More experienced
    Arch users find some of the helper tools provided by other distributions cumbersome,
    and things that are sitting in the way of easy and fast configuration. The Arch
    Linux community is also known to be very open and willing to give advice.'

    using a Linux-based operating system. This is where Arch Linux is one of the leading
    distributions where all configurations and decisions regarding the system are
    taken by the user. In the end, the user defines the system. Arch Linux is built
    in such a way that you can—if you really want to—rebuild the entire system. It
    even provides a simple tool to do so. The entire system and all of the components
    are 100 percent transparent, so you can replace everything with something else
    providing the same functionality. In addition to this, Arch Linux also provides
    the freedom to use exclusively open source software, but you can also without
    hassle use proprietary software packages.'

    install with continuous updates without ever having to reinstall or having to
    go to massive procedures for getting the system upgraded. The goal of bleeding
    edge is also to provide for the newest features popping up in the Linux world—be
    it in the field of filesystems (ext4, ReiserFS, XFS, JFS, Btrfs, NILFS, and so
    on), software RAID, or boot scripts (systemd)—along with supporting the latest
    features of the newest hardware because of the immediate availability of the newest
    kernels.
