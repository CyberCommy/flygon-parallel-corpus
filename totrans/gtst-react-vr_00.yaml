- en: Virtual Reality, from a computer standpoint, has been around since the 1960s.
    It started up again in a big way in the late 90's, and then mostly collapsed for
    a while—although it's never really gone away. It is back now, and, this time,
    it is here to stay.

- en: What has made this change is the cell phone—the large, high-resolution display
    technology used in cell phones has helped created HMDs (Head Mounted Displays,
    or VR Goggles). Circuits and computers are also vastly faster than they used to
    be; computer graphics that used to cost a quarter of a million dollars in 1998
    now costs less than two thousand and is even faster.

- en: Building VR worlds has always been difficult, however. You had to be a C++ programmer
    and know an immense amount about high speed programming, real-time graphics, geometry,
    and other complex topics. This has been simplified in the last few years with
    game development engines—simplified, but only to a point.

- en: With React VR, it is even simpler. You can code a VR world now using React syntax,
    a simple declarative HTML-like language. If you want to create a box, you just
    declare a box with the right width, height, and so forth, instead of having to
    write procedural code. The syntax may be simple, but these worlds can be event
    driven, animated, and responsive to user input as well as obtaining information
    from the web.

- en: This will enable you to build complex virtual worlds with simple JavaScript
    and HTML-like code. This uses a new browser-based programming paradigm called
    WebVR; regular browsers on PCs and on mobile devices can now view worlds in VR.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You will need a Windows PC, of nearly any type; for maximum enjoyment, you will
    need  VR rig. Either an HTC Vive, Oculus Rift, a Samsung Gear VR, Google Daydream,
    or other VR goggles (including the Google Cardboard) and a cell phone.

- en: You can develop these WebVR worlds even if you don't have a sophisticated **Head
    Mounted Display** (**HMD**) or **VR Headset** ; you can view them in flat mode
    on your regular computer screen.  You can pick up a simple VR cell phone holder/headset
    (Google Cardboard or similar) for less than 20 dollars or even free in many places,
    so don't let hardware be a barrier to learning about the next great thing.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book is for anyone who wants to learn Virtual Reality on the web and create
    engaging 3D websites with WebVR through React VR. You will pick this up quickest
    if you have already known some JavaScript, and even faster if you already know
    React or React Native. Even if you don't, the book will show you step by step
    what to do. If you already know how to do polygon modeling, this will help, but
    this book will also show people how to use the free and open source Blender to
    do some basic modeling if needed, and where to get free downloads. You do not
    need a VR rig to be able to enjoy this book—you can do the samples with a regular
    PC and even publish it on the internet.
