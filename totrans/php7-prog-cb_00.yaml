- en: PHP 7 has taken the open source community by storm, breaking records for speed,
    which is, metaphorically, causing heads to turn. In its most fundamental sense,
    the core engineering team has effected a major rewrite of the language but has
    still managed to maintain backward compatibility to a high degree. The impact
    of these internal changes is outwardly manifested in an almost 200% increase in
    speed, with significant savings in memory usage. From a development perspective,
    changes in how commands are parsed along with a uniform variable syntax have introduced
    new ways to write code which were simply not possible in the earlier versions
    of PHP. By the same token, any developer who is unaware of how commands are interpreted
    in PHP 7 can fall into unseen traps, which causes the code to malfunction. Accordingly,
    the mandate of this book is to illustrate new and exciting ways to write code
    and to point out any areas of incompatibility with previous versions of PHP. It
    is also important to note that this book addresses both PHP 7.0 and 7.1.

    helps you get started with the initial setup and configuration of your PHP 7 development
    environment. We will also present a few hard-hitting initial recipes, which show
    off new features of PHP 7.'

- en: '[Chapter 2](ch02.html "Chapter 2. Using PHP 7 High Performance Features"),
    *Using PHP 7 High Performance Features*, takes a deep dive into the new features
    of the language. You will be introduced to the concepts of the abstract syntax
    tree and uniform variable syntax, among others, and you will learn how these can
    affect day-to-day programming. This is followed by recipes that take advantage
    of PHP 7 performance improvements, including significant new changes in the `foreach()`
    loop handling.'

- en: '[Chapter 3](ch03.html "Chapter 3. Working with PHP Functional Programming"),
    *Working with PHP Functional Programming*, emphasizes how PHP has always had the
    capability of working with programmer-defined libraries of functions rather than
    classes, and PHP 7 is no exception. In this chapter, we will take a closer look
    at improvements in the handling of functions, including the ability to provide
    "type hints" involving basic data types, such as integer, float, Boolean, and
    string for both input and output. We will also provide extensive coverage of iterators
    from the Standard PHP Library, as well as how to write your own iterators by taking
    advantage of improved handling of generators.'

    *Working with PHP Object-Oriented Programming*, explores the basics of PHP object-oriented
    programming. Quickly getting beyond the basics, you will learn how to use PHP
    namespaces and traits. Architectural considerations will be covered, including
    how to best use interfaces. Finally, an exciting new PHP 7 feature, anonymous
    classes, will be discussed along with practical examples of its use.'

    with a Database*, explores the ability to have your application read from and
    write to a database, which is a critical part of any modern website. What is widely
    misunderstood, however, is the proper use of the PHP Data Objects (PDO) extension.
    This chapter will present thorough coverage of PDO, which in turn will allow your
    applications to interact with most major databases, including MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL,
    IBM DB2, and Microsoft SQL Server, without having to learn any other set of commands.
    In addition, we will cover advanced techniques, such as working with Domain Model
    Entities, performing embedded secondary lookups, and implementing jQuery DataTable
    lookups using PHP 7.'

    Websites*, delves into one of the classic problems faced by PHP developers building
    interactive websites—hardcoding HTML forms and later having to perform maintenance.
    A neat and efficient object-oriented approach is presented in this chapter, which,
    with a minimal amount of code, lets you generate entire HTML forms that can easily
    be changed in the initial configuration. Another equally vexing problem is how
    to filter and validate data posted from a form. In this chapter, you will learn
    how to develop an easily configurable filtering and validation factory, which
    can then be applied to any incoming post data.'

    Services*, covers something that is becoming more and more important to web development—the
    ability to publish or consume web services. This chapter covers the two key approaches:
    SOAP and REST. You will learn how to implement SOAP and REST servers and clients.
    Further more, the recipes presented use the Adapter design pattern, which allows
    a considerable degree of customization, meaning that you are not locked into a
    specific design paradigm.'

    Aspects"), *Working with Date/Time and International Aspects*, helps you cope
    with the fierce competition owing to the growth of the World Wide Web (WWW), leading
    to more and more customers looking to expand their business into international
    markets. This chapter will get you up to speed on all aspects of internationalization,
    including the use of emoticons, complex characters, and translation. Further more,
    you will be shown how to acquire and handle regional information, including language
    settings, number and currency formatting, as well as date and time. Additionally,
    we will cover recipes that show you how to create internationalized calendars,
    which can handle recurring events.'

    deals with the hottest topic in the open source community right now—middleware.
    As the name implies, middleware is software that can be *snapped* into place,
    which adds value to an existing application without having to alter the source
    code of that application. In this chapter, you will be shown a series of recipes,
    implemented as PSR-7-compliant middleware (see [Appendix](apa.html "Appendix A. Defining
    PSR-7 Classes"), *Defining PSR-7 Classes*, for more details), which perform authentication,
    access control, caching, and routing.'

    at Advanced Algorithms*, helps you understand that, as a developer, given the
    tremendous number of programmers and companies competing for the same business,
    it is extremely important that you gain mastery of key advanced algorithms. In
    this chapter, using PHP 7, you will learn the theory and application of getters
    and setters, linked lists, bubble sorts, stacks, and binary search. In addition,
    this chapter examines how to use these techniques to implement a search engine,
    and how to handle multi-dimensional arrays.'

    *Implementing Software Design Patterns*, works on an important aspect of object-oriented
    programming, that is, an understanding of key software design patterns. Without
    this knowledge, when applying for a new position or attempting to attract new
    customers, you, as a developer, will be at a severe disadvantage. This chapter
    covers several critically important patterns including Hydration, Strategy, Mapper,
    Object Relational Mapping, and Pub/Sub.'

    today. We see cyber attacks being launched with greater and greater frequency,
    often with devastating financial and personal loss. In this chapter, we will present
    solid practical recipes that, if implemented, will give your websites an exponential
    boost in terms of safety and security. Topics covered include filtering and validation,
    session protection, secure form submission, secure password generation, and the
    use of CAPTCHAs. In addition, a recipe is presented that will show you how to
    encrypt and decrypt data without using the PHP mcrypt extension, which is deprecated
    in PHP 7.1 (and will ultimately be removed from the language).'

    of your code to produce well written code that works. In this chapter, you will
    also learn how to set up and create unit tests, handle unexpected errors and exceptions,
    and generate test data. Several new PHP 7 features are presented, including how
    PHP 7 can "throw" errors. It is important to note that *best practices* are identified
    throughout the book, not just in this chapter!'

    as URI, body, and file upload, as well as request and response objects.'

- en: All you need to successfully implement the recipes presented in this book will
    be a computer, 100MB of extra disk space, and a text or code editor (not a word
    processor!). The first chapter will cover how to set up a PHP 7 development environment.
    Having a web server is optional as PHP 7 includes a development web server. An
    Internet connection is not required, but it might be useful to download code (such
    as the set of PSR-7 interfaces), and review PHP 7.x documentation.
