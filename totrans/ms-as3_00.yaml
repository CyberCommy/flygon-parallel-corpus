    the wide variety of UI design tools the IDE provides, including the powerful visual
    layout editor, automatic constraint layout tools and animated material icons.

- en: Once the IDE's design tools have been mastered, the book continues by exploring
    code development with Android Studio and its many helpful and innovative programming
    tools, such as code completion, template customization, and most importantly,
    the fantastic testing and profiling tools that are provided with Android Studio
    3.

- en: Android Studio is not just a great tool for vanilla coding; it provides all
    manner of additions and extensions in the form of plugins and native language
    support for languages such as C++ and Kotlin. It is this extensibility of the
    native SDK that makes Mastering Android Studio 3 such an essential skill-set for
    any mobile developer, and the most useful and popular of these are covered in
    detail to give the reader mastery of what is without doubt one of today's most
    exciting development tools.
