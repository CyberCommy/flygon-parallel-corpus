- en: Building websites that display well on everything from web-enabled smartphones
    to tablets, to laptops and desktops, is a daunting challenge. The myriad permutations
    of screen sizes and browser types might be a reason enough to not even try. But
    if your business counts on getting web content to people on these devices and
    you need your business to look tech-savvy, you must put your best foot forward.
    In this book, you will see that with the help of some easy-to-understand principles
    and an open source framework you can build a mobile first responsive website fast.

- en: You should have Windows or Linux. The instructions in this book favor Mac OS
    X and Linux, but for the most part we will only be writing plain text and using
    very few command-line tools. In places where we do, I have done my best to offer
    up resources for how to get similar results on a Windows computer. You should
    also have a text editor. It will be very helpful if you know how to launch and
    use a command-line tool.

- en: In terms of technical skills, this book is targeted at both beginners to intermediate
    developers as well as designers. In other words, you should already know how to
    build an HTML page and style it with CSS by using a text editor of some kind.
    You don't have to be an expert at any of these things though. You also don't need
    to be a command-line expert, but hopefully you are open to using command-line
    tools. They are quite helpful.
