- en: Securing IT infrastructure and customer data for any organization is of paramount
    importance; information security programs ensure reliable, uninterruptible, and
    safe operation of any system. Information security is a broad domain and can be
    divided into several categories for efficiency and expertise, such as web application
    security, mobile application security, and network security.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Each category has its own background requirements, for example, a developer
    can become a good web application tester, a mobile application developer can have
    a better hang on Mobile application security, Network and system administrators
    can become Network/System/DevOps security engineers. It is not necessary to be
    having prior knowledge but one needs to know a good know how of the domain they
    are performing security assessment for.

    will list all the things you should take care of before commencing a penetration
    test. You should have clear answers to questions such as what is a penetration
    test? how is it different from vulnerability assessment? why should we as an organization
    do penetration testing? and who should do the penetration testing-the internal
    team or an external vendor who specializes in security assessment?

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Penetration testing is a security-oriented strategic probing of the system from
    internal or external with little or no prior knowledge of the system itself, to
    seek out vulnerabilities that an attacker could exploit. When we talk about penetration
    testing, it is not restricted to a standalone machine; it can be any combination
    of web or network application, host or networks, and on cloud or in premises.
    In other words, penetration testing is the activity of assessing all the components
    of IT infrastructure, including but not limited to operating systems, network
    communication protocols, applications, network devices, IoT connected devices,
    physical security, and human psychology, using the exact same target approach
    and method as that of an attacker but performed by authorized and experienced
    security professionals well within the scope approved by the Board or managers
    of the organization.

    that looks for security weaknesses, potentially gaining access to the computer''s
    features and data" is the definition provided by Wikipedia. There are variations
    of pen tests in simulating internal penetration or external penetration, and varying
    the amount of target information provided. Each one of them has its own benefits,
    but it actually depends on what gets you maximum assurance and also, what the
    need of the moment is.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Vulnerability assessment is the activity of mapping network services and versions
    against publically available exploits. It is non-intrusive but based on actively
    gathered information and correlated with the available range of exploits based
    on different versions.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Vulnerability assessment can be performed on web applications, network protocols,
    network applications, network devices, and servers anywhere on the cloud or in
    premises. At times, vulnerability assessment is what is needed as the employer,
    organization, or client may not be ready for penetration testing as they fear
    breaking systems or loosing data, or both due to penetration testing.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It is worth noting that vulerability assessment is not actual exploitation,
    but it is matching the correlated data from the public sources that mention availability
    of exploit for the given version of services over the network/system. It contains
    false positives.

    a penetration test gives the executives, architects, and product managers 360-degree
    birds-eye view of the security posture of the organizations. Penetration testing
    also helps the decision makers in understanding what an actual attack will look
    like and what will be its impact on business, revenue, and goodwill. The process
    involves rigorous analysis of security, technical, and operational countermeasures
    for any potential vulnerability that ranges from poor to improper configuration
    to network, to hardware, firmware, or software flaws. It also helps in focusing
    on what''s important by narrowing down the security risk and knowing how effective
    the current security measures are. There are other principle reasons as well:'

    and what to do in the event of a breach. It gives an idea of what an actual attack
    will look like. It also helps identify whether a gap is a technical gap or non-technical
    gap, such as users clicking on phishing e-mail giving access to attacks directly
    to their laptops, defeating all the network security devices and rules in firewall.

    or quarterly. Invariably, the best and cost-efficient way is to have an internal
    testing team that has knowledge of penetration testing and can perform real-time
    assessments with the help of CERT, Exploit-DB, NVD, and more. Having a security

    generally, is a very expensive activity. One needs to carefully assess the scenario
    and decide whether an external entity is effective or an in-house team will be
    effective; both have their own pros and cons. One of the criteria comprises of
    the trustworthiness and maintaining the confidentiality of the flaws found by
    the people coming to the organization to pentest; one never knows the other person's
    motives. Also, a lot of thought has to be put into ensuring that information is
    not leaked out when the activity is outsourced. One also does not get a clear
    understanding of their underlying infra when this activity is carried out once
    a year; it just gives a picture of what the organization looks like at that point
    in time.

    deviations from this can be catastrophic. In order to understand the purpose of
    this, one needs to understand that penetration testing is an activity that consumes
    a lot of bandwidth of an underlying infrastructure. No organization would want
    to have their networks stalled in the middle of core business hours or peak activity
    of their business. Other factors could include excessive traffic causing network
    congestion and crashing. There are many other critical factors that need to be
    addressed before starting with the activity. A kickoff meeting should be called
    with the stakeholders and clear boundaries of testing should be determined as
    to where and in which areas the testing is to be done. Once that is concluded,
    it is feasible to draw the effective time to perform the activity so as to ensure
    that the network is not affected and business is not impacted. One should also
    consider the time taken to perform this activity; it is necessary to define a
    timeline because this impacts the financials and the availability of testers.
    Shortlisting the devices to be tested and audited should also be documented.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Discussing when to run the penetration tests for various shortlisted devices
    should be concluded in the meeting. Mapping down the critical servers to the non-critical
    ones and deciding their timeliness for performing tests so that business is not
    affected has to also be mutually agreed upon. A call should be taken by the organization
    as to whether they want to inform their team of an ongoing penetration test; doing
    so will ensure that the business is not impacted, however, the proactiveness of
    detecting an incident will go out of scope. Not informing the team about an ongoing
    penetration test can have its own perks and pitfalls; one being that if the network
    team detects an attack, it will follow the procedure and have a total lockdown
    of the network that could cause business loss and slow down the business functions
    leading to partial chaos.

    of systems are desktops. Then, the testing should be focused on the n-m systems,
    for example, the servers. Here the tester can gain knowledge of what kind of devices
    they are and then the exploitation can begin. The exploitation should be a timed
    activity as the chances of the application or the device crashing might increase
    and the business can be impacted if the exploitation fails. A timeline should
    be drawn up as to how much time should be permitted to perform the entire testing
    activity once the count of vulnerabilities is identified.

- en: This activity can be concluded with success. However, one has to know that this
    is not a foolproof mechanism. This is because the pen tester is given a limited
    amount of time to perform the activity while attackers do not have a timeline

    multiple vulnerabilities.
