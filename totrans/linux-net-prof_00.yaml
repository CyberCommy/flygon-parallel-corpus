- en: Welcome to *Linux for Networking Professionals*! If you've ever wondered how
    to reduce the cost of hosts and services that support your network, you've come
    to the right place. Or if you're considering how to start securing network services
    such as DNS, DHCP, or RADIUS, we can help you on that path as well.

- en: If there's a service that helps you support your network, we've tried to cover
    how to get it up and running with a basic configuration, as well as helping you
    to start securing that service. Along the way, we've tried to help you pick a
    Linux distribution, show you how to use Linux for troubleshooting, and introduce
    you to a few services that you maybe didn't know that you needed.

    network, and maybe helps you understand your network a bit better along the way!

- en: This book is meant for anyone tasked with administering network infrastructure
    of almost any kind. If you are interested in the nuts and bolts of how things
    work in your network, this book is for you! You'll also find our discussion interesting
    if you are often left wondering how you will deliver the various services on your
    network that your organization needs, but might not have the budget to pay for
    commercial products. We'll cover how each of the Linux services we discuss works,
    as well as how you might configure them in a typical environment.

    find lots to interest you! We discuss how attackers and malware commonly attack
    various services on your network, and how to defend those services.

    deploying and defending the services we cover is measured more in your enthusiasm
    and time for learning new and interesting things, rather than in dollars and cents!

    Linux distributions. Also, we provide some advice for selecting a Linux distribution

    Network Configuration and Operations – Working with Local Interfaces*, discusses
    network interface configuration in Linux, which can be a real stumbling block
    for many administrators, especially when the decision has been made that a server
    doesn''t need a GUI. In this chapter, we''ll discuss how to configure various
    network interface parameters, all from the command line, as well as lots of the
    basics of IP and MAC layer lore.'

    problems, which is a daily journey for almost all network administrators. In this
    chapter, we''ll continue the exploration that we started in the previous chapter,
    layering on TCP and UDP basics. With that in hand, we''ll discuss local and remote
    network diagnostics using native Linux commands, as well as common add-ons. We''ll
    end this chapter with a discussion of assessing wireless networks.'

    explains that the Linux firewall can be a real challenge for many administrators,
    especially since there are multiple different "generations" of the iptables/ipchains
    firewall implementation. We''ll discuss the evolution of the Linux firewall and
    implement it to protect specific services on Linux.'

    the environment it''s deployed to. We''ll discuss these challenges, as well as
    various security standards that you can use to inform your security decisions.
    In particular, we''ll discuss the **Center for Internet Security** (**CIS**) Critical
    Controls, and work through a few of the recommendations in a CIS Benchmark for

- en: In this book, we'll base most of our examples and builds on a default installation
    of Ubuntu Linux. You can certainly install Ubuntu on "bare metal" hardware, but
    you may find that using a virtualization solution such as VMware (Workstation
    or ESXi), VirtualBox, or Proxmox can really benefit your learning experience (all
    of these except for VMware Workstation are free). Using virtualization options,
    you can take "snapshots" of your host at known good points along the way, which
    means that if you clobber something while experimenting with a tool or feature,
    it is very easy to just roll back that change and try it again.
  id: totrans-24
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Also, using virtualization allows you to make multiple copies of your host so
    that you can implement features or services in a logical way, rather than trying
    to put all the services we discuss in this book on the same host.

    you will of course split important servers across different hosts.
