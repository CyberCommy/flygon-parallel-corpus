    and data networks that can be accessed across any vector.

- en: Before we discuss the channels, we will look at the main points to take away
    from the OSSTMM process. As you may recall, the OSSTMM provides a measurement
    of operational security. As the manual states, this operational security is the
    concept of separation and controls. Moreover, for a threat to be effective, it
    has to interact with the asset that it is trying to attack.
  id: totrans-33
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 在讨论这些渠道之前，我们将看一下OSSTMM流程的主要要点。您可能还记得，OSSTMM提供了操作安全的测量。正如手册所述，这种操作安全是分离和控制的概念。此外，对于威胁要有效，它必须与它试图攻击的资产进行交互。
- en: 'When you look at this, what the OSSTMM is saying is that we can have 100 percent
    security if we can achieve total separation between the threat and the asset!
    While this is something that we would love to achieve, it is not something that
    is possible with the majority of the networks and services that we have today.
    Therefore, we apply controls to mitigate and reduce the risk from providing access
    that could be leveraged with a threat. The OSSTMM breaks operational security
    into the following elements:'

  zh: 当你看到这个时，OSSTMM所说的是，如果我们能够实现威胁和资产之间的完全分离，我们就可以实现100%的安全！虽然这是我们希望实现的目标，但对于今天大多数网络和服务来说是不可能的。因此，我们应用控制措施来减轻和降低提供可能被威胁利用的访问的风险。OSSTMM将操作安全分解为以下元素：

    electromagnetic and microwave radiation sources that can cause harm to hearing
    and sight. Therefore, it might be required that the analyst wear protective equipment
    when in the range of any sources that are measured at -12dB and greater. Unfortunately,
    this is something that is often overlooked, but it is essential that the tester
    be protected within environments that could place them at risk. There are many
    potential dangers from close proximity to these types of sources. Consequently,
    when testing outside in locations with antennas, ensure both the frequencies and
    the strength of the signals that are in the vicinity of the test site have been

    a report. Unfortunately, it is one of the things that usually gets the least amount
    of attention. When it comes to testing, most classes will show you the showboat
    skills of exploitation and other things. However, the reality is that the more
    time you spend learning how to draft and create a report, the better you will
    be at delivering what the client wants, and that is a report on your findings
    and moreover, a complete list of your recommendations to improve their security
    posture based on these findings.

    organization that has these guidelines clearly defined and implemented. The first
    one on the list, the security policy, is one of the most important guidelines,
    but often gets the least amount of attention from organizations. It is essential
    that an organization not only have a well-defined policy, but that they follow
    it! We will not focus on these items as we are more interested in the process
    and methodology of the testing and assessment for the purpose of this book. However,
    it is important that we, as testers, know of the types of recommendations so that
    we can pass that information on to our clients, or at the very least, provide
    them with the reference information so that they can explore as they wish.

    of following a methodology, and this is what we will take and focus on from the
    NIST publication. Within the NIST guidance, they define the methodology as a repeatable
    and documented assessment process that can be beneficial; it provides consistency
    and structure to testing, provides for training of new assessment staff, and addresses
    resource constraints associated with security assessments. Virtually all assessments
    will have limitations of some type; these limitations can be time, staff, hardware,
    software, or a number of other challenges. To alleviate these types of challenges,
    the organization needs to understand what type of security tests and examinations
    they will execute.

- en: By developing an appropriate methodology, taking the time to identify the required
    resources, and planning the structure of the assessment, an organization can mitigate
    the challenge of resource availability. A powerful benefit of this is that the
    organization can establish components that can be used on follow-on assessments.
    As the organization conducts more and more assessments, this process will continue
    to be refined and at the same time, improve the time required for the testing.

    We will discuss some of these locations and how they can be a part of our assessment
    methodology. We have the external and internal viewpoints in accordance with the
    NIST publication that we will address. External testing is conducted outside an
    organization's perimeter and views the security posture from the outside; moreover,
    it is conducted from the point of view of the Internet and that of an external
    attacker. For internal testing, the assessors work from the inside and are emulated
    either as an insider or as an external attacker who has penetrated the perimeter
    defenses. This testing focuses on the system-level security and configuration
    as well as authentication, access control, and system hardening.

    usually conducted first. This is beneficial when the same tester is conducting
    the testing to prevent them from developing inside information that an external
    tester would not have and consequently invalidating or making the test less authentic.
    When the internal testing is being conducted, there should be no changes made
    by the client to the network architecture.

    internal testing with the knowledge of the IT staff. That is, the staff is in
    an alerted state and knows that an assessment is taking place. This can help,
    in some cases, limit the impact of the testing. Furthermore, it can serve as a
    training opportunity for the organization staff to learn more information about
    testing and in some cases, learn how they can perform self-assessment for their
    organization.

    to testing. That is, it performs the test without the knowledge of the organization's
    IT staff, but with permission of the upper staff and management. There are cases
    when an organization needs to designate a trusted third party to ensure that an
    incident response plan does not go into action as a result of the testing. The
    purpose of covert testing is to examine the damage an adversary can cause. Moreover,
    this testing does not focus on identifying vulnerabilities and does not test every
    security control. This testing is purely adversarial and usually involves finding
    a vulnerability and then exploiting it to gain access to the system and/or network.

    TCP/IP knowledge as a baseline skill set. This is something that corresponds with
    what I have seen in industry, which is the importance of understanding protocols
    and being able to analyze them at the packet level. Many of you reading this are
    probably thinking that you need to have an extensive background and a high level
    of knowledge when it comes to TCP/IP, and this is a good thing. Unfortunately,
    the majority of the consultants or people who want to become consultants I meet
    do not have the required detailed knowledge of TCP/IP. This has led me to write
    a course on the foundations and core concepts of being in security. One of the
    main components of the course is TCP/IP. It is imperative that as a tester you
    understand all layers of the network model, and moreover, you interpret and analyze
    different events at the packet level across the corresponding layers.

    target vulnerability validation techniques. This step of professional security
    testing is called pen testing. As defined by NIST, this section of the publication
    addresses validation of vulnerabilities that have been discovered in the other
    steps of the methodology. The objective of this step is to prove that the vulnerability
    and that it not only exists but it also creates a security exposure that can be
    exploited. As we have mentioned before, the act of vulnerability validation, which
    is more often referred to exploitation, is not 100 percent. Therefore, it is crucial
    during the phases of testing that we have conducted the tests thoroughly and systematically
    so that we can identify those vulnerabilities that will provide us with the highest
    chance of a successful validation. It is important to note that this technique
    carries with it the greatest amount of risk. This is because these techniques
    have more potential to impact the targets. Moreover, this can and has on more
    than one occasion crashed the tested target. It is imperative that you proceed
    with caution anytime you are performing validation.

    into play. This involves taking the information that we have previously discovered
    and comparing this to a vulnerability database. Much like we did earlier in the
    book, the process looks for the information that we have identified and then finds
    vulnerabilities that we can potentially exploit as we progress to the next phase
    of attack. For the most part, this is initially carried out with automated scanners.
    Once the scanner has identified a potential vulnerability, we then move on to
    a deeper investigation of the finding to see if it in fact is a weakness and how
    we can leverage or validate the vulnerability with an exploit. Consequently, this
    process is manual and can be time consuming.
  id: totrans-223
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The attack phase is where we go about validating our identified potential vulnerabilities
    by attempting to exploit them. If we are successful in the validation, then it
    means the exploit worked and the vulnerability exists. Consequently, if the exploit
    is not successful, it does not mean that the vulnerability does not exist; it
    just means that we could not successfully exploit it when we attempted validation.
    There can be any number of reasons for this, and it is beyond the scope of this
    chapter to address them. Another point to consider is the fact that we might exploit
    the machine, but only have the access level of a low or non-privileged user. The
    tester may be able to escalate their privileges and gain access to additional
    resources. These are all components of what we do as testers when we discover
    information that we can potentially exploit.

    where we produce the deliverable for the client. It is also a critical component
    that continues simultaneously with the other phases. Consequently, at the end
    of the test, we develop a report of the findings and provide it to the client.
    This is the showcase of the assessment; it shows the client what has been done
    and also provides them a detailed listing of the findings. Also, for each finding,
    it provides an analysis on it and a recommendation or procedure to either remove
    or mitigate the risk of the vulnerability.
