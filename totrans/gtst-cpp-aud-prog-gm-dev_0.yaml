- en: Audio is certainly one of the most powerful tools at our disposal when it comes
    to making the players feel something from a video game. Audio can serve many different
    purposes in video games, such as giving feedback with sound effects, increasing
    immersion with ambient tracks, telling stories with recorded speech, or conveying
    all kinds of emotions through background music.

- en: Video games have been making use of sound since their earliest days. For instance,
    the 1972 classic, Pong, used a beep sound effect to provide feedback whenever
    the ball collided with something, with different pitches used to distinguish between
    collisions with the walls, collisions with the paddles, or the ball leaving the
    game court.

- en: Space Invaders, on the other hand, made a very clever use of its rudimentary
    background music by progressively increasing the speed of the song as the danger
    of the alien invasion drew closer, thus enhancing the feelings of tension within
    the player. Studies have shown that gamers that played the game without sound
    did not feel the same sense of urgency, and their heart rates did not rise like
    the ones that played the game with the sound turned on.

- en: Since those days, there have been many advances in technology, which allowed
    audio in games to evolve considerably. Most games began using recorded audio instead
    of crude synthesized tones, and new techniques such as 3D audio now allow the
    players to feel like the sound is coming from all around them and interacting
    with the game environment.

- en: Music has also played a very important role in video games. The popular Final
    Fantasy games owe a great portion of their emotional impact to the sweeping, cinematic
    soundtracks composed by Nobuo Uematsu. The most memorable scenes in the series
    would have not been the same without the music that accompanied them.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Many developers and composers have also looked into ways of making the music
    react to the game play. For example, starting with Monkey Island 2, *LeChuck's
    Revenge*, every graphic adventure game that LucasArts created uses a custom interactive
    music system called iMUSE, which among other features, allows seamless musical
    transitions between themes as the player moves from one room to another.

- en: 'There are even games that incorporate audio concepts directly into their main
    gameplay mechanics, such as the songs that the player has to memorize and play
    in *The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time*, and games that revolve entirely around
    sound, with the most popular examples being rhythm games, such as *PaRappa the
    Rapper*, *Dance Dance Revolution*, or *Guitar Hero*.'

- en: However, despite being such an important part of video games, many game development
    books skim through the subject of audio programming. Even the ones that dedicate
    a chapter to audio, often only teach you the very basics, such as loading and
    playing audio files, or use outdated audio engines instead of the ones used by
    the industry nowadays. Additionally, other game development topics, such as graphics,
    physics, or artificial intelligence tend to be more enticing to beginner level
    game developers and learning about audio becomes less of a priority.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The main goal of this book is to give you a crash course on audio programming
    for games by using a popular and well-established audio engine, and covering the
    subject from several different levels of abstraction. It is my hope that this
    approach will give you enough knowledge to implement most of the audio features
    that are normally required for a video game, and form a foundation so that you
    may pursue other topics that are more advanced.
