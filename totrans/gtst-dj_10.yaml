    This example has allowed us to verify that the audit login and password was transparent
    to the user. Indeed, the `authenticate()` and `login()` methods allow the developer
    to save a lot of time. Django also provides convenient shortcuts for the developer
    such as the `user.is_authenticated` attribute that checks if the user is logged
    in. Users prefer when a logout link is present on the website, especially when
    connecting from a public computer. We will now create the logout page.
