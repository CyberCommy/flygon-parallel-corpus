- en: The WEP protocol was introduced with the original 802.11 standard as a means
    to provide authentication and encryption to wireless LAN implementations. It is
    based on the **RC4** (**Rivest Cipher 4**) stream cypher with a **preshared secret
    key** (**PSK**) of 40 or 104 bits, depending on the implementation. A 24 bit pseudo-random
    **Initialization Vector** (**IV**) is concatenated with the preshared key to generate
    the per-packet keystream used by RC4 for the actual encryption and decryption
    processes. Thus, the resulting keystream could be 64 or 128 bits long.

- en: First of all, we must say that WEP is an insecure protocol and has been deprecated
    by the Wi-Fi Alliance. It suffers from various vulnerabilities related to the
    generation of the keystreams, to the use of IVs and to the length of the keys.
  id: totrans-11
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The IV is used to add randomness to the keystream, trying to avoid the reuse
    of the same keystream to encrypt different packets. This purpose has not been
    accomplished in the design of WEP, because the IV is only 24 bits long (with 2^24
    = 16,777,216 possible values) and it is transmitted in clear-text within each
    frame. Thus, after a certain period of time (depending on the network traffic)
    the same IV, and consequently the same keystream, will be reused, allowing the
    attacker to collect the relative cypher texts and perform statistical attacks
    to recover the plain texts and the key.
  id: totrans-12
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The first well-known attack against WEP was the **Fluhrer, Mantin and Shamir**
    (**FMS**) attack, back in 2001\. The FMS attack relies on the way WEP generates
    the keystreams and on the fact that it also uses *weak* IVs to generate weak keystreams,
    making possible for an attacker to collect a sufficient number of packets encrypted
    with these keystreams, analyze them, and recover the key.
  id: totrans-13
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The number of IVs to be collected to complete the FMS attack is about 250,000
    for 40-bit keys and 1,500,000 for 104-bit keys.

    than the ones discovered by Fluhrer, Mantin, and Shamir, that can used to crack
    the WEP key.
  id: totrans-16
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In 2007, **Pyshkin, Tews, and Weinmann** (**PTW**) extended Andreas Klein's
    research and improved the FMS attack, significantly reducing the number of IVs
    needed to successfully recover the WEP key.
  id: totrans-17
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Indeed, the PTW attack does not rely on weak IVs like the FMS attack does and
    is very fast and effective. It is able to recover a 104-bit WEP key with a success
    probability of 50 percent using less than 40,000 frames and with a probability
    of 95 percent with 85,000 frames.

  id: totrans-19

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Both the FMS and PTW attacks need to collect quite a large number of frames
    to succeed and can be conducted passively, sniffing the wireless traffic on the
    same channel of the target AP and capturing frames. The problem is that, in normal
    conditions, we will have to spend quite a long time to passively collect all the
    necessary packets for the attacks, especially with the FMS attack.
  id: totrans-20
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To accelerate the process, the idea is to re-inject frames in the network to
    generate traffic in response so that we could collect the necessary IVs more quickly.
    A type of frame that is suitable for this purpose is the ARP request, because
    the AP broadcasts it and each time with a new IV. As we are not associated with
    the AP, if we send frames to it directly, they are discarded and a de-authentication
    frame is sent. Instead, we can capture ARP requests from associated clients and
    retransmit them to the AP.
