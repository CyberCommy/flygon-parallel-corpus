    with the specific purpose of developing, testing, and packaging Android applications.
    It can be downloaded, along with the Android SDK, as a single package, but as
    we shall see throughout the course of this book, it is, in reality, a collection
    of tools and components, many of which are installed and updated independently
    of each other.

    plugins that provide a large array of valuable functions, not available directly
    via the IDE. These include plugins to speed up build times, debug a project over
    Wi-Fi, and many more. The most useful and popular of these will be covered in
    the relevant sections. Throughout the book, we will be finding ways to speed up
    tedious and difficult tasks using these plugins and Android Studio's built in
    components.

    profoundly different.

    IDEs is its layout editor, which is far superior to any of its rivals, offering
    text, design, and blueprint views, and most importantly, constraint layout tools for
    every activity or fragment, an easy-to-use theme and style editors, and a drag-and-drop
    design function. The layout editor also provides many tools unavailable elsewhere,
    such as a comprehensive preview function for viewing layouts on a multitude of
    devices and simple-to-use theme and translation editors.'

    completes code as you type makes it a delight to use. It regularly anticipates
    what you are about to type, and often a whole line of code can be entered with
    no more than two or three keystrokes. Refactoring too, is easier and more far-reaching
    than alternative IDEs, such as Eclipse and NetBeans. Almost anything can be renamed,

    allowing developers to create device emulators to model any number of real-world
    devices. These emulators are highly customizable, both in terms of form factor
    and hardware configurations, and virtual devices can be downloaded from many manufacturers.

- en: '**Build tools:** Android Studio employs the Gradle build system, which performs
    the same functions as the Apache Ant system that many Java developers will be
    familiar with. It does, however, offer a lot more flexibility and allows for customized
    builds, enabling developers to create APKs that can be uploaded to TestFlight,
    or to produce demo versions of an app, with ease. It is also the Gradle system
    that allows for the modular nature discussed previously. Rather than each library
    or a third-party SDK being compiled as a JAR file, Studio builds each of these
    using Gradle.'

- en: These are the most far-reaching differences between Android Studio and other
    IDEs, but there are more as well as many features that are unique. Studio provides
    the powerful JUnit test facility and allows for cloud platform support and even
    Wi-Fi debugging. It is also considerably faster than Eclipse, which, to be fair,
    has to cater for a wider range of development needs, as opposed to just one, and
    it can be run on less powerful machines.

- en: Android Studio also provides an amazing time-saving device in the form of Instant
    Run. This feature cleverly only builds the part of a project that has been edited,
    meaning that developers can test small changes to code without having to wait

    waiting times down from minutes to almost zero.

    called `strings.xml` in the values directory and that it contained two `strings.xml`
    files. This, in fact, is presented this way only to help us organize our resources.
    An examination of the `project` folder on disk will show that there are in fact
    two (or more) folders inside the `res` directory named `values` and `values-fr`.
    Not only does this help organize our work but it also helps minimize the space
    our apps take up on a device, as only the resource folders that are needed are
    installed on an end device.

    suit the particular task we are working on. Being able to select appropriate tools
    like this is one of Android Studio's most useful features. Of course, Android
    Studio is nothing more than a frontend interface that allows us to connect with
    the real power behind Android, the SDK.

    this is to be expected, as creating a fully functioning virtual device is a remarkably
    complex task. There are, however, a few things that can be done to speed things
    up a little by designing each virtual device to match the particular tasks of
    the app we are developing. For example, if your app does not make use of the device
    camera, then do not include it in the configuration. Likewise, do not allocate
    much more memory than the app itself requires.

    a small but growing number of third-party emulators. Many of these are designed
    with gamers rather than developers in mind; although Genymotion is specifically
    a development tool, it contains more functions and is generally faster than the
    native emulators. Its only drawbacks are that is only free for personal use and

    reinstalled. This could prove very time-consuming, especially on less powerful
