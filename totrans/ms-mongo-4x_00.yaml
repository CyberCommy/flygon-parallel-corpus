- en: MongoDB has grown to become the de facto NoSQL database with millions of users,
    from small start-ups to Fortune 500 companies. Addressing the limitations of SQL
    schema-based databases, MongoDB pioneered a shift of focus for DevOps and offered
    sharding and replication that can be maintained by DevOps teams. This book is
    based on MongoDB 4.0 and covers topics ranging from database querying using the
    shell, built-in drivers, and popular ODM mappers, to more advanced topics such
    as sharding, high availability, and integration with big data sources.

- en: You will get an overview of MongoDB and will learn how to play to its strengths,
    with relevant use cases. After that, you will learn how to query MongoDB effectively
    and make use of indexes as much as possible. The next part deals with the administration
    of MongoDB installations, whether on-premises or on the cloud. We deal with database
    internals in the following section, explaining storage systems and how they can
    affect performance. The last section of this book deals with replication and MongoDB
    scaling, along with integration with heterogeneous data sources. By the end this
    book, you will be equipped with all the required industry skills and knowledge
    to become a certified MongoDB developer and administrator.

    ACID characteristics, which is a new functionality introduced in MongoDB 4.0.

- en: Chapter 6, *Aggregation*, dives deep into the aggregation framework. We also
    discuss when and why we should use aggregation, as opposed to MapReduce and querying
    the database.

    database, which is indexing.

- en: Chapter 8*, Monitoring, Backup, and Security*, discusses the operational aspects
    of MongoDB. Monitoring, backup, and security should not be an afterthought, but
    rather are necessary processes that need to be taken care of before deploying
    MongoDB in a production environment.

    that we didn't manage to discuss in the previous chapters, and places emphasis
    on security and a series of checklists that developers and DBAs should keep into
