    data structures and algorithms that you can use while developing applications
    in the C# language. Arrays, lists, stacks, queues, dictionaries, hash sets, trees,
    heaps, and graphs, as well as accompanying algorithmsâ€”it's quite a broad range
    of subjects, isn't it? Now it is high time to summarize this knowledge, as well
    as to remind you about some specific applications for particular structures.

    two groups, namely linear and non-linear. Then, the topic of diversity of applications
    of various data structures is taken into account. You will see a short summary
    of each described data structure, as well as information about some problems which
    can be solved with the use of a particular data structure.
