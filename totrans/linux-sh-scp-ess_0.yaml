- en: The shell on a GNU/Linux system is arguably the most powerful tool for any user.
    In general terms, the shell serves as an interface between the system's user and
    the operating system kernel. We use the shell to run commands in order to perform
    tasks and frequently save the output to files. While these simple use-case are
    easy to achieve by just using some commands on the shell, sometimes the task at
    hand is more complex than that.

- en: Enter shell scripting, the magical tool that allows you to write step-by-step
    instructions to the shell on how to perform a complex task. However, just learning
    the syntax to write scripts is not enough unless you know the commands at your
    disposal. Only then would scripts be reusable, efficient, and easy to use. When
    one has mastered the commands available on a GNU/Linux system, what follows is
    a frenzy to automate daily tasks—be it finding documents or cleaning up old movies
    that have long been watched. Whether you're an expert with other scripting languages
    or you're doing this for the first time, this book will show you how to do magic
    with shell scripts!

    *The Beginning of the Scripting Journey*, tells you about the importance of writing
    shell scripts along with a simple Hello World shell script program. It also covers
    the basic and essential shell script topics such as defining a variable, built-in
    variables, and operators. It also contains a detailed explanation of shell expansion
    that occurs with characters such as ~, *, ?, [], and {}.'

    and Filters"), *Getting Hands-on with I/O, Redirection Pipes, and Filters*, talks
    about the standard input, output, and error streams for a command and shell script.
    It also has instructions on how to redirect them to other streams. One of the
    most powerful concepts, namely regular expressions, is also covered. It serves
    as instructions to commands such as `grep`, `sed`, `uniq`, and `tail` for filtering

    Writing*, provides an insight into structuring shell scripts to organize tasks.
    After talking about script exit codes, it talks about basic programming constructs
    such as conditionals and loops. It then goes on to discuss the organization of
    code into functions and aliases. Finally, it wraps up with details on how `xargs`,
    `pushd`, and `popd` works.'
