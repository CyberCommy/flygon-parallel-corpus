- en: The shell on a GNU/Linux system is arguably the most powerful tool for any user.
    In general terms, the shell serves as an interface between the system's user and
    the operating system kernel. We use the shell to run commands in order to perform
    tasks and frequently save the output to files. While these simple use-case are
    easy to achieve by just using some commands on the shell, sometimes the task at
    hand is more complex than that.

- en: Enter shell scripting, the magical tool that allows you to write step-by-step
    instructions to the shell on how to perform a complex task. However, just learning
    the syntax to write scripts is not enough unless you know the commands at your
    disposal. Only then would scripts be reusable, efficient, and easy to use. When
    one has mastered the commands available on a GNU/Linux system, what follows is
    a frenzy to automate daily tasks—be it finding documents or cleaning up old movies
    that have long been watched. Whether you're an expert with other scripting languages
    or you're doing this for the first time, this book will show you how to do magic
    with shell scripts!

- en: '[Chapter 1](ch01.html "Chapter 1. The Beginning of the Scripting Journey"),
    *The Beginning of the Scripting Journey*, tells you about the importance of writing
    shell scripts along with a simple Hello World shell script program. It also covers
    the basic and essential shell script topics such as defining a variable, built-in
    variables, and operators. It also contains a detailed explanation of shell expansion
    that occurs with characters such as ~, *, ?, [], and {}.'

    and Filters"), *Getting Hands-on with I/O, Redirection Pipes, and Filters*, talks
    about the standard input, output, and error streams for a command and shell script.
    It also has instructions on how to redirect them to other streams. One of the
    most powerful concepts, namely regular expressions, is also covered. It serves
    as instructions to commands such as `grep`, `sed`, `uniq`, and `tail` for filtering
    useful data from input data.'

    Writing*, provides an insight into structuring shell scripts to organize tasks.
    After talking about script exit codes, it talks about basic programming constructs
    such as conditionals and loops. It then goes on to discuss the organization of
    code into functions and aliases. Finally, it wraps up with details on how `xargs`,
    `pushd`, and `popd` works.'

- en: '[Chapter 4](ch04.html "Chapter 4. Modularizing and Debugging"), *Modularizing
    and Debugging*, talks about making shell scripts modular by using common code
    that can be sourced. It also covers the details of command line arguments to scripts
    and how one can debug their scripts when they malfunction. This chapter also contains
    information on how the user can implement custom command completion.'

- en: '[Chapter 5](ch05.html "Chapter 5. Customizing the Environment"), *Customizing
    the Environment*, moves on to talk about the shell environment - what it contains,
    its significance, and finally how to modify it. It also takes the reader through
    the different initialization files that bash uses at startup. Finally, we talk
    about how to check command history and manage running tasks.'

- en: '[Chapter 6](ch06.html "Chapter 6. Working with Files"), *Working with Files*,
    talks about files, which are the entities that most of any UNIX system is composed
    of. It covers the basic philosophy of "everything is a file" and takes the reader
    through basic file operations, comparing files, finding them, and creating links.
    This chapter then explains what special files and temporary files are, and the
    details involved in file permissions.'

    Processes*, talks about executable files that come alive—and become processes.
    From listing and monitoring running processes, it goes on to talk about how to
    exploit process substitution. Next, it covers process scheduling priorities, signals,
    traps, and how processes can communicate with each other.'

    scheduling tasks at appropriate times by using the system Cron. Next, it covers
    systems that are responsible for orchestrating startup tasks in most modern Linux
    systems. Finally, this chapter contains instructions on how to embed scripts from
    other scripting languages into a shell script.'
