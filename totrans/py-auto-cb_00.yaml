- en: We are all probably spending time doing small manual tasks that don't add much
    value. It may be scanning through information sources in search of the small bits
    of relevant information, working with spreadsheets to generate the same graph
    over and over, or searching files one by one until find the data we're looking
    for. Some—probably most—of those tasks are, in fact, automatable. There's an investment
    upfront, but for the tasks that get repeated over and over, we can use computers
    to do these kinds of menial tasks and focus our own efforts instead on what humans
    are good for—high-level analysis and decision making based on the result. This
    book will explain how to use the Python language to automatize common business
    tasks that can be greatly sped up if a computer is doing them.

- en: Given the expressiveness and ease of use of Python, it's surprisingly simple
    to start making small programs to perform these actions and combine them into
    more integrated systems. Throughout the book, we will show small, easy-to-follow
    recipes that can be adapted to your specific needs, and we will combine them to
    perform more complex actions. We will perform common actions, such as detecting
    opportunities by scraping the web, analyzing information to generate automatic
    spreadsheet reports with graphs, communicating with automatically generated emails,
    getting notifications via text messages, and learning how to run tasks while your
    mind is focused on other more important stuff.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book is for Python beginners, not necessarily developers, that want to
    use and expand their knowledge to automate tasks. Most of the examples in the
    book are aimed at marketing, sales, and other non-tech areas. The reader needs
    to know a little of the Python language, including its basic concepts.
