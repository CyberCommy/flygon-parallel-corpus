- en: We just finished mastering work with backend and API. We are approaching the
    end of our journey, but it's not over yet! We have to cover some very important
    points! One such is performance optimization. We will guide you through some good
    practices in achieving this. Think about the code we have developed so far and
    how can we apply these advices on it.

    a performance killer! For example, you can have multiple `LinearLayout` views
    nested. Instead of this, switch to `RelativeLayout`. This can save your performance
    significantly! Nested layouts require more processing power to be used on calculations
    and drawing.'

- en: Include layouts into your screens only when they are needed--If you don't need
    view at the moment, set its visibility to `Gone` instead of `Invisible`. `Invisible`
    will still create an instance of view. When using `Gone`, Android will instantiate
    view only when visibility is changed to `Visible`.

    too much work in your application. Too much processing can affect your battery.
    However, we will point out ways you can save your battery and what you must avoid.

- en: In this short but important chapter, we highlighted important points about maintaining
    and achieving good application performance and responsiveness. These advices are
    crucial in application optimization. So, if your application doesn't follow these
    rules, you must optimize it accordingly. By finishing this chapter, we covered
    all you need to develop Android applications. In the next chapter, we will test
    it. Be ready to write some unit and instrumentation tests!
