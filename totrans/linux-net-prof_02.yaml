    – in particular, how Linux can work well for networking services. We'll start
    by discussing some of the history of the operating system before looking at its
    basic configuration and troubleshooting. From there, we'll work through building
    various network-related services on Linux that you may commonly see in most organizations.
    As we progress, we'll build real services on real hosts, with an emphasis on securing
    and troubleshooting each service as we go. By the time we're done, you should
    be familiar enough with each of these services to start implementing some or all
    of them in your own organization. As they say, *every journey begins with a single
    step*, so let's take that step and start with a general discussion of the Linux
    platform.

    history, and culture of Linux *steers* administrators toward scripting and automating
    processes. While carrying this to extremes can get people into funny situations,
    scripting routine tasks can be a real time-saver.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In fact, scripting non-routine tasks, such as something that needs doing once
    per year, can be a lifesaver as well – it means that administrators don't need
    to relearn how to do that thing they did 12 months ago.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Scripting routine tasks is an even bigger win. Over many years, Windows administrators
    have learned that doing one task hundreds of times in a **Graphical User Interface**
    (**GUI**) guarantees that we misclick at least a few times. Scripting tasks like
    that, on the other hand, guarantees consistent results. Not only that, but over
    a network, where administrators routinely perform operations for hundreds or thousands
    of stations, scripting is often the only way to accomplish tasks at larger scales.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another reason that network administrators prefer Linux platforms is that Linux
    (and before that, Unix) has been around since there were networks to be a part
    of. On the server side, Linux (or Unix) services are what defined those services,
    where the matching Windows services are copies that have mostly grown to feature
    parity over time.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: On the workstation side, if you need a tool to administer or diagnose something
    on your network, it's probably already installed. If the tool that you seek isn't
    installed, it's a one-line command to get it installed and running, along with
    any other tools, libraries, or dependencies required. And adding that tool does
    not require a license fee – both Linux and any tools installed on Linux are (almost
    without exception) free and open source.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Lastly, on both the server and desktop side, historically, Linux has been free.
    Even now, when for-profit companies have license fees for some of the main supported
    distributions (for instance, Red Hat and SUSE), those companies offer free versions
    of those distributions. Red Hat offers Fedora Linux and CentOS, both of which
    are free and, to one extent or another, act as test-bed versions for new features
    in Red Hat Enterprise Linux. openSUSE (free) and SUSE Linux (chargeable) are also
    very similar, with the SUSE distribution being more rigorously tested and seeing
    a more regular cadence for version upgrades. The enterprise versions are typically
    term-licensed, with that license granting the customer access to technical support
    and, in many cases, OS updates.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    OS, but many other companies choose to build their infrastructures on free versions
    of OpenSUSE, CentOS, or Ubuntu. The availability of free versions of Linux means
    that many organizations can operate with substantially lower IT costs, which has
    very much influenced where we have gone as an industry.

    was developed in the late 1960s and early 1970s at Bell Labs. Dennis Ritchie and
    Ken Thompson were Unix's main developers. The name Unix was actually a pun based
    on the name **Multics**, an earlier operating system that inspired many of Unix's
    features.

    (a recursive acronym – **GNU's Not Unix**) project, which aspired to create a
    Unix-like operating system available to all for free. Out of this effort came
    the *GNU Hurd* kernel, which most would consider the precursor to today's Linux
    versions (the SFS would prefer we called them all GNU/Linux).

    It's important to note that mainstream Linux is normally considered to be a kernel
    that can be used to create an operating system, rather than an operating system
    on its own. Linux is still maintained with Linus Torvalds as the lead developer,
    but today, there is a much larger team of individuals and corporations acting
    as contributors. So, while technically Linux only refers to the kernel, in the
    industry, *Linux* generally refers to any of the operating systems that are built
    upon that kernel.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Since the 1970s, hundreds of separate flavors of Linux have been released. Each
    of these is commonly called a **distribution** (or **distro**, for short). These
    are each based on the Linux kernel of the day, along with an installation infrastructure
    and a repository system for the OS and for updates. Most are unique in some way,
    either in the mix of base packages or the focus of the distro – some might be
    small in size to fit on smaller hardware platforms, some might focus on security,
    some might be intended as a general-purpose enterprise *workhorse* operating system,
    and so on.

- en: Some distros have been "mainstream" for a period of time, and some have waned
    in popularity as time has gone by. The thing they all share is the Linux kernel,
    which they have each built upon to create their own distribution. Many distros
    have based their operating system on another distro, customizing that enough to
    justify calling their implementation a new distribution. This trend has given
    us the idea of a "Linux family tree" – where dozens of distributions can grow
    from a common "root." This is explored on the DistroWatch website at [https://distrowatch.com/dwres.php?resource=family-tree](https://https://distrowatch.com/dwres.php?resource=family-tree).

    **Berkeley Software Distribution** (**BSD**) Unix. BSD Unix is a descendent of

    and many of its derivatives are still free and share many characteristics (and
    a fair amount of code) with Linux.

    was announced that CentOS would no longer be maintained as a RHEL-compatible distribution
    but would rather "fit" somewhere between Fedora and RHEL – not so new as to be
    "bleeding edge," but not as stable as RHEL either. As part of this change, CentOS

    version of the OS, which comes with optimizations and tools pre-installed for
    parallel computing. OpenSUSE occupies an "upstream" position to SLES, where changes
    can be introduced in a distro that is somewhat more "forgiving" to changes that
    might not always work out the first time. The OpenSUSE Tumbleweed distro has the
    newest features and versions, where as OpenSUSE Leap is closer in versioning and

    with many (but not all) of the same features. AppArmor is available on Ubuntu,
    SUSE, and most other distros (with the notable exception of RHEL). Both options
    take a policy-based approach to significantly increase the overall security posture
    of the OS they are installed on.

    each built slightly differently. This is a short road to your infrastructure becoming
    the proverbial "science experiment" that never ends!

- en: Contrast this with another client – their first server was a **SUSE Linux for
    SAP**, which is, as the name suggests, a SUSE Linux server, packaged with the
    SAP application that the client purchased (SAP HANA). As their Linux footprint
    grew with more services, they stuck with the SUSE platform, but went with the
    "real" SLES distribution. This kept them on a single operating system and, equally
    important for them, a single support license with SUSE. They were able to focus
    their training and expertise on SUSE. Another key benefit for them was that as
    they added more servers, they were able to apply a single "stream" of updates
    and patches with a phased approach. In each patch cycle, less critical servers
    got patched first, leaving the core business application servers to be patched
    a few days later, after their testing was complete.

    If people on your team have strong feelings about one of these, then definitely
    take that into consideration. You will likely want to stay fairly close to one
    of the mainstream distributions so that you can use it within your organization,
    something that is regularly maintained and has a paid subscription model available
    for support – even if you don't feel you need paid support today, that may not
    always be the case.

- en: Now that we've discussed the history of Linux, along with several of the main
    distributions, I hope you are in a better position to appreciate the history and
    the central importance of the operating systems in our society. In particular,
    I hope that you have some good criteria to help you choose a distro for your infrastructure.

    which, in its LTS version, has an OS that we can depend on being supported as
    you work through the various scenarios, builds, and examples that we'll discuss.
    It's also the distribution that is native to Windows (in Windows services for
    Linux). This makes it an easy distro to become familiar with, even if you don't
    have server or workstation hardware to spare or even a virtualization platform
    to test with.

    on the network. We'll illustrate working with the local interfaces and adding
    IP addresses, subnet masks, and any routes required to get your Linux host working
    in a new or existing network.
