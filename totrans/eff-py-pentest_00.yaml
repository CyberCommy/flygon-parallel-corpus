- en: Python is a high-level and general-purpose language with clear syntax and a
    comprehensive standard library. Often referred to as a scripting language, Python
    is dominant in information security with its low complexity, limitless libraries,
    and third-party modules. Security experts have singled out Python as a language
    for developing information security toolkits, such as w3af . The modular design,
    human-readable code, and fully developed suite of libraries make Python suitable
    for security researchers and experts to write scripts and build tools for security
    testing.

- en: Python-based tools include all types of fuzzers, proxies, and even the occasional
    exploit. Python is the driving language for several current open source penetration-testing
    tools from Volatility for memory analysis to libPST for abstracting the process
    of examining e-mails. It is a great language to learn because of the large number
    of reverse engineering and exploitation libraries available for your use. So,
    learning Python may help you in difficult situations where you need to extend
    or tweak those tools.

    and libraries to aid his or her day-to-day work.

- en: '[Chapter 1](ch01.html "Chapter 1. Python Scripting Essentials"), *Python Scripting
    Essentials*, breaks the ice by providing the basic concepts of Python scripting,
    installing third-party libraries, threading, process execution, exception handling,
    and penetration testing.'

- en: '[Chapter 2](ch02.html "Chapter 2. Analyzing Network Traffic with Scapy"), *Analyzing
    Network Traffic with Scapy*, introduces a packet-manipulation tool, Scapy, which allows
    users to sniff, create, send, and slice packets for analysis. The chapter provides
    insight into investigating network traffic using Scapy, parsing DNS traffic, packet
    sniffing, packet injection, and passive OS fingerprinting. This empowers you to
    create and send custom packets over the network and analyze the raw output received
    for various protocols.'

    *Application Fingerprinting with Python*, discusses the basics of fingerprinting
    web applications using Python. You will master the techniques of web scraping,
    e-mail gathering, OS fingerprinting, application fingerprinting, and information
    gathering using Python libraries.'

    with Python*, addresses this issue of attacks with Python scripts needing to be
    addressed for efficient penetration testing by detailing the techniques of attacks
    and OWASP top vulnerabilities. You will learn to write scripts to exploit the
    same.'

- en: '[Chapter 5](ch05.html "Chapter 5. Fuzzing and Brute-Forcing"), *Fuzzing and
    Brute-Forcing*, tells you how fuzzing and brute-forcing still remain the top attacks
    tackled by testers. This chapter summarizes fuzzing and brute-forcing passwords,
    directories, and file locations; brute-force cracking ZIP files; HTML form authentication;
    and the Sulley fuzzing framework. This enables the user to extend the fuzzing
    tools for pentesting requirements with Python.'
