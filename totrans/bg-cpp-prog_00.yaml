- en: 'C++ has been used for 30 years, and during that time, many new languages have
    come and gone, but C++ has endured. The big question behind this book is: Why?
    Why use C++? The answer lies in the ten chapters you see in front of you but,
    as a spoiler, it is the flexibility and power of the language and the rich, broad
    Standard Library.'

- en: C++ has always been a powerful language, giving you direct access to memory
    while providing high-level features such as the ability to create new types—classes—and
    to override operators to suit your needs. However, the more modern C++ standards
    added to this, generic programming through templates, and functional programming
    through function objects and lambda expressions. You can use as much or as little
    of these features as you want; you can write event-driven code with abstract interface
    pointers, or C-like procedural code.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this book, we will take you through the features of the 2011 standard of
    C++ and the Standard Library provided with the language. The text explains how
    to use these features with short code snippets, and each chapter has a worked
    example illustrating the concepts. At the end of this book, you will be aware
    of all the features of the language and what can be possible with the C++ Standard
    Library. You will start this book as a beginner, and finish it informed and equipped
    to use C++.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book covers the C++11 standard, and the associated C++ Standard Library.
    For the vast majority of this book, any C++11 compliant compiler is suitable.
    This includes compilers from Intel, IBM, Sun, Apple, and Microsoft, as well as
    the open source GCC compiler.
  prefs: []

- en: This book uses Visual C++ 2017 Community Edition because it is a fully featured
    compiler and environment, and it is provided as a free download. This is a personal
    choice of the author, but it should not restrict readers who prefer using other
    compilers. Some of the sections of the last chapter on *Diagnostics and Debugging*
    describe Microsoft-specific features, but these sections are clearly marked.
