- en: '*Mastering Linux Shell Scripting* will become your Bible and a handbook to
    create and edit bash shell scripts in Linux, OS X, or Unix. Starting with the
    fundamentals, we quickly move onto helping you create useful scripts with practical
    examples. In this way, your learning becomes effective and quick. With each chapter,
    we provide explanations of the code and code examples, so from a learning book
    this becomes a book that you can use as a ready reference, if you need to understand
    how to program a specific task.'

    "Chapter 1. What and Why of Scripting with Bash"), *What and Why of Scripting
    with Bash*, explains how to create and name scripts. Once you have the script
    created you can make it executable and welcome yourself to the world. If you have
    little or no knowledge of scripting then you can start here.'

    "Chapter 2. Creating Interactive Scripts"), *Creating Interactive Scripts*, covers
    the scripts we will need to work in a more flexible manner and accept arguments
    or even prompt the user for input during the script execution. I am sure that
    you have seen scripts similar to this asking for installation directories or server''s
    tp connect to.'

    "Chapter 3. Conditions Attached"), *Conditions Attached*, covers the use of keywords,
    such as "if", and commands like "test". It tells us how we can start creating
    decision structures in the code and then prompt the user for input, if we have
    not provided arguments; otherwise, we can run silently.'

    "Chapter 4. Creating Code Snippets"), *Creating Code Snippets*, covers the vim
    text editor, which is very powerful and also syntax highlighting to help us edit
    the script. However, we can also read into files of the current script. In this
    way, we can create snippets of code to represent commonly used blocks.'

    the test command to just a single [, we can also use [[ and (( depending on your

    are also conditional statements. We can repeat a block of code while a condition
    is true or false. In this way, using for, while, or until we can have the script
    complete the repetitive code sequences.'

    *with Functions*, covers how functions can encapsulate the code that we need to
    repeat within the script. This can help with readability and how easy a script
    is to maintain.'

    create virtual hosts on an Apache HTTPD server. We use sed within the scripts
    to edit the template used to define virtual hosts.'

    about the first practical example we look at with awk, allowing us to process
    log files on the web server. It also looks at how to report the IP address that
    has access to the server most often, as well as, how many errors occur and of

    this book. In the book we use examples that are produced using the Raspbian distribution
    on a Raspberry Pi; however, Linux distribution should be sufficient. If you have
    access to the command line in OS X on Apple systems, then you should be able to
    carry out most of the exercises without Linux.
