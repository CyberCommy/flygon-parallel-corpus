- en: The continuous growth of the computer software market leads to a very competitive
    and challenging era. Not only does your software need to be functional and easy
    to use, it must also look appealing and professional to the users. In order to
    gain an upper hand and a competitive advantage over other software products in
    the market, the look and feel of your product is of utmost importance and should
    be taken care of early in the production stage. In this book, we will teach you
    how to create a functional, appealing, and user friendly software using the Qt5
    development platform.
