- en: Laravel has become one of the fastest growing PHP frameworks ever. With its
    expressive syntax and excellent documentation, it's easy to get a fully functioning
    web application up-and-running in very little time. Additionally, the use of modern
    PHP features makes Version 4 of Laravel very easy to customize to our own needs
    and also makes it easy for us to create a highly complex site if need be. It's
    a perfect blend of the simple and advanced.

- en: This book covers merely a fraction of all that Laravel is capable of. Think
    of it more as a starting point, with code examples to get things working. Then
    customize them, add to them, or combine them to create your own applications.
    The possibilities are endless.

- en: One of the best things about Laravel is the community. If you're ever stuck
    on a problem and doing a Google search isn't helping, there are always people
    willing to help out. You can find helpful community members on IRC (`#laravel`
    on Freenode) or the forums ([http://forums.laravel.io](http://forums.laravel.io))
    or you can contact the many Laravel users on Twitter.
