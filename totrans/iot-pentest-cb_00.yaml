- en: IoT is a term used to reference embedded devices connected to a network in some
    form or fashion. Some devices are retrofitted to include modules that connect
    them to a network, and others are cutting edge devices created for specific needs.
    In each case, these devices create a risk to the safety of enterprises, nations,
    and individuals. Whether you are new to penetration testing or a seasoned pen
    tester, *IoT Penetration Testing Cookbook* contains recipes to help security professionals
    holistically assess and defend IoT ecosystems.
