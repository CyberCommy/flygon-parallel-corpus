- en: So far in this book, we have covered most of the issues surrounding web application
    security and penetration testing, albeit briefly. However, due to the nature of
    web applications—which represent such a mixture of diverse technologies and methodologies
    that do not always work well together—the number of specific vulnerabilities and
    different types of attacks targeting these applications is so large and rapidly
    changing that no single book could possibly cover everything; hence, some things
    must be left out.

    in web applications that sometimes escape the focus of developers and security
    testers, not because they are unknown (in fact, some are in *OWASP Top 10*), but
    because their impact is sometimes underestimated in real-world applications, or
    because vulnerabilities such as SQL injection and XSS are much more relevant because
    of their direct impact on users'' information. The vulnerabilities covered in
    this chapter are as follows:'

    to retrieve a different file. This is called **path traversal** or *directory

    or code from a file stored locally on a server. Referencing files other than the

    can be later referenced by the main application.

    to determine the name of the file to include; hence, a user can set the name of
    a malicious file previously uploaded to the server (Local File Inclusion) or the
    name of a file in another server (Remote File Inclusion).

- en: Local File Inclusion
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In a **Local File Inclusion** (**LFI**) vulnerability, files local to the server
    are accessed by the `include` function without proper validation; that is, files
    containing server code are included in a page and their code is executed. This
    is a very practical feature for developers, as they can reuse code and optimize
    their resources. The problem arises when user-provided parameters are used to
    select the files to be included and when insufficient or no validation is made.
    Many people confuse an LFI flaw with the path traversal flaw. Although the LFI
    flaw often exhibits the same traits as the path traversal flaw, the application
    treats both the flaws differently. With the path traversal flaw, the application
    will only read and display the contents of the file. With the LFI flaw, instead
    of displaying the contents, the application will include the file as part of the
    interpreted code (the web pages making up the application) and execute it.
  prefs: []

- en: In the path traversal vulnerability explained earlier, we used the *File Inclusion*
    exercise from DVWA and actually did an LFI when we used `../../index.php` as the
    parameter and the `index.php` page was interpreted as code. Nonetheless, including
    files that are already on the server and that serve a legitimate purpose for the
    application sometimes doesn't pose a security risk, unless an unprivileged user
    is able to include an administrative page. In the case where all pages on the
    server are innocuous, how can you as a penetration tester demonstrate that there
    is a security issue by allowing the inclusion of local files? You need to upload
    a malicious file and use it to exploit the LFI further.
