    We will try to understand some diagrams depicting how Skaffold works. We will
    also learn how to bootstrap our project with Skaffold by covering some basics
    of the Skaffold configuration file. We will learn about Skaffold installation
    and various commands that we can use in different pipeline stages, that is, `init`,
    `build`, and `deploy`. Then, finally, in this section, we explain different ways
    of building and deploying container images with Skaffold.
