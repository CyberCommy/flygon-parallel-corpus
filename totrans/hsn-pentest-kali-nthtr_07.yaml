    target to learn about where the live targets are and what they have left open,
    before trying to extract more detailed information through enumeration. During
    this process, we learned quite a bit, but we still have further to go as we learn
    more about both the process and how Kali NetHunter can assist us. We are now moving
    into the step where we actually put the penetration in penetration test by attempting
    to gain access to the target itself. Everything up to this point has allowed us
    to plan, learn, and prepare to make a successful attempt at entry.

    but we will limit our focus to a handful of these and show how Kali Nethunter
    may be helpful in carrying them out. Expect to carry out various tasks during
    this part of the process, which is designed to crack or recover passwords, escalate
    privileges, execute applications, hide files, cover tracks, and otherwise conceal
    evidence of your actions. It's all in a day's work, so let's fire Kali Nethunter

    use a password that you have obtained for an account on the system. Of course,
    obtaining this password is the important part as you must find a way to obtain
    a password for a valid account. This is where a process known as password-cracking
    or password-recovery comes into play.

    movies and TV have to say about the topic, password-cracking is a catchall term
    for a group of techniques used to gain possession of this piece of information.
    You can expect to use any individual, or combination of, methods during the process—each
    of which has its pros and cons. You can guess a password blindly or you may have
    some information about the system owner that may make the guessing process easier.
    Other techniques to obtain passwords may involve repeatedly guessing or exploiting
    security weaknesses in a system.

    ARP protocol (which associates an IP address with a specific MAC address if you
    recall from your basic network experience) to make the systems we are targeting
    believe we are the router (when we are not).
  id: totrans-34

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Since we are using ARP poisoning, we are using falsified ARP messages across
    the network with the goal of changing the ARP cache on systems. Under normal conditions,
    when a system sends out an ARP request, it is looking for the MAC address that
    corresponds to the given IP address. When responded to, the return message will
    include the IP address and MAC address of the system that matches the request,
    which will then be cached in the requester's system. When we poison these caches,
    we send a message out that rewrites the cache with a different MAC address, which
    will route the traffic differently to that which the network owner would have
    intended. This has the effect of directing traffic in a myriad of different ways.

    hashes of all the different combinations of characters created using a given hashing
    method. In practice, the rainbow table will be created by the pentester, who will
    choose the parameters for creating the hashes. For example, parameters defining

    though a hash isn't reversible, we have already explained that a rainbow table
    may be employed to look up what created a hash; however, there is a problem that
    hasn't been addressed. This problem is that there are multiple hashing algorithms
    and the same input will produce different results on each. So we need to identify
    the hash algorithm before we can go too far; fortunately, we have ways to do this.

    can harness the CPU of a system, but also has the ability to make use of a faster
