    of them would take more than this whole chapter if I described them in depth.

    `measure`, we define another function, `wrapper`, and then we return it. So, the
    net effect is that after the decoration point, when we call `f`, we're actually
    calling `wrapper`. Since the `wrapper` inside is calling `func`, which is `f`,
    we are actually closing the loop like that. If you don't believe me, take a look

    We define `wrapper`, inside of which we check the result of the original function's
    call. The beauty of this approach is that from the innermost level, we can still
    refer to as both `func` and `threshold`, which allows us to set the threshold

    of objects is that an object's method can access and often modify the data attributes
    of the object with which they are associated (objects have a notion of "self").
    In OO programming, computer programs are designed by making them out of objects
    that interact with one another.

    `join` method of a string object (an empty string object, in this case). By calling
    `join` on an empty string, the result is that all elements in the iterable you
    pass to `join` will be concatenated together. We feed `join` a generator expression

    point we find a difference, it means the string isn't a palindrome and therefore

    wouldn't change the name, of course) so that the age is stored in a private `_age`
    variable, and we define property getters and setters using that decoration, which
    allows us to keep using the `person` instances as we were before. A getter is
    a method that is called when we access an attribute for reading. On the other
    hand, a setter is a method that is called when we access an attribute to write
    it. In other languages, such as Java, it's customary to define them as `get_age()`
    and `set_age(int value)`, but I find the Python syntax much neater. It allows
    you to start writing simple code and refactor later on, only when you need it,
    there is no need to pollute your code with accessors only because they may be
    helpful in the future.

- en: I find Python's approach to **operator overloading** to be brilliant. To overload
    an operator means to give it a meaning according to the context in which it is
    used. For example, the `+` operator means addition when we deal with numbers,
    but concatenation when we deal with sequences.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In Python, when you use operators, you're most likely calling the special methods
    of some objects behind the scenes. For example, the `a[k]` call roughly translates
    to `type(a).__getitem__(a, k)`.

    of different types.

    it is. As long as it exposes the start method, we can call it. That's polymorphism
    in action.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In other languages, such as Java, in order to give a function the ability to
    accept different types and call a method on them, those types need to be coded
    in such a way that they share an interface. In this way, the compiler knows that
    the method will be available regardless of the type of the object the function
    is fed (as long as it extends the proper interface, of course).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In Python, things are different. Polymorphism is implicit, nothing prevents
    you from calling a method on an object; therefore, technically, there is no need
    to implement interfaces or other patterns.

- en: 'There is a special kind of polymorphism called **ad hoc polymorphism**, which
    is what we saw in the last paragraph: operator overloading. This is the ability

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Polymorphism also allows Python programmers to simply use the interface (methods
    and properties) exposed from an object rather than having to check which class
    it was instantiated from. This allows the code to be more compact and feel more
    natural.

    and `speed` are both floats, and both are given a default value. It's also interesting
    that I didn't have to write any `__init__` method, it's done for me by the `dataclass`

    the next item of the data stream until the stream is exhausted, at which point
    all successive calls to `__next__` simply raise the `StopIteration` exception.

    `__next__` on an object, behind the scenes.'

    object itself, and then one for `__next__`. Let's go through it. What needed to
    happen was the return of `_data[0]`, `_data[2]`, `_data[4]`, ..., `_data[1]`,
    `_data[3]`, `_data[5]`, ... until we had returned every item in the data. In order
    to do that, we prepared a list and indexes, such as [`0`, `2`, `4`, `6`, ...,
    `1`, `3`, `5`, ...], and while there was at least an element in it, we popped
    the first one and returned the element from the data that was at that position,
    thereby achieving our goal. When `indexes` was empty, we raised `StopIteration`,
    as required by the iterator protocol.
