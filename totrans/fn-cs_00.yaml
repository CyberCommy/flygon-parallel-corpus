- en: Some of us may be used to developing an application using the object orientation
    programming technique and don’t care about the functional programming technique.
    However, there are benefits to using functional programming. One of the benefits
    is that we will get a new perspective on our programming code since the function
    in functional programming is identical to a mathematical function. Because it's
    identical to a mathematical function, the function in functional programming contains
    no side-effects, which means that the function invocation will have no effect
    on other functions in the class. We will discuss more details about the benefits
    and other things related to functional programming in this book.

- en: '[Chapter 1](text00016.html#ch01 "Chapter 1. Tasting Functional Style in C#")
    , *Tasting Functional Style in C#* , introduces the functional programming approach
    by discussing its concepts and the comparison between functional and imperative
    programming. We also try to refactor a simple imperative code into a functional
    approach.'

    Delegates* , covers the definition, syntax, and use of delegates. We also discuss
    the variance of delegates and the built-in delegate.'

- en: '[Chapter 3](text00028.html#ch03 "Chapter 3. Expressing Anonymous Methods with
    Lambda Expressions") , *Expressing Anonymous Methods with Lambda Expressions*
    , walks us through the concept of delegates and uses it to create and use an anonymous
    method. After we dig through the anonymous method, we can transform it into a
    lambda expression and then apply it to functional programming.'

    with Extension Methods") , *Extending Object Functionality with Extension Methods*
    , elaborates the benefits of using the extension method in functional programming.
    Before that, we discuss the use of the extension method and also discuss how to
    get this new method in IntelliSense. Also, we try to invoke the extension method
    from other assemblies.'

    with LINQ") , *Querying Any Collection Easily with LINQ* , enumerates the LINQ
    operator provided by C# and compares the two LINQ syntaxes: Fluent Syntax and
    Query Expression Syntax. We also discuss deferred execution in the LINQ process.'

    of the Functional Program with Asynchronous Programming* , covers asynchronous
    programming for the functional approach. It will explain the Asynchronous Programming
    Model and the Task-based Asynchronous pattern.'

    talk about laziness thinking and the caching technique in order to optimize our
    code.'

    with Pattern* , covers the advantages of using patterns compared to conventional
    switch-case operations. We discuss pattern matching and monad in this chapter.
    We use the pattern matching feature, which is the new feature provided by C# 7.'

    in the previous chapter to create an application using the functional approach.'

    of an honest signature and dealing with the side-effects. We also separate the
    code into domain logic and mutable shell and then test it using unit testing.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To walk through this book and successfully compile all the source code, we require
    a personal computer that runs Microsoft Windows 10 (or higher) with Visual Studio
    Community 2015 Update 3 installed for the running of code in chapters 1-8, 10,
    11 and Visual Studio Community 2017 RC (Release Candidate) installed for the running
    of code in chapter 9\. We also need the .NET Framework 4.6.2 unless you need to
    recode all the source code to run in your current version of .NET Framework. You
    also need .NET Core 1.0 if you want to compile all code in another platform since
    all code are compatible with .NET Core 1.0.
