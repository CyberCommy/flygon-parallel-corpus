- en: Some of us may be used to developing an application using the object orientation
    programming technique and don’t care about the functional programming technique.
    However, there are benefits to using functional programming. One of the benefits
    is that we will get a new perspective on our programming code since the function
    in functional programming is identical to a mathematical function. Because it's
    identical to a mathematical function, the function in functional programming contains
    no side-effects, which means that the function invocation will have no effect
    on other functions in the class. We will discuss more details about the benefits
    and other things related to functional programming in this book.

    , *Tasting Functional Style in C#* , introduces the functional programming approach
    by discussing its concepts and the comparison between functional and imperative
    programming. We also try to refactor a simple imperative code into a functional
    approach.'

    method. After we dig through the anonymous method, we can transform it into a
    lambda expression and then apply it to functional programming.'

    Before that, we discuss the use of the extension method and also discuss how to
    get this new method in IntelliSense. Also, we try to invoke the extension method
    from other assemblies.'

    a personal computer that runs Microsoft Windows 10 (or higher) with Visual Studio
    Community 2015 Update 3 installed for the running of code in chapters 1-8, 10,
    11 and Visual Studio Community 2017 RC (Release Candidate) installed for the running
    of code in chapter 9\. We also need the .NET Framework 4.6.2 unless you need to
    recode all the source code to run in your current version of .NET Framework. You
    also need .NET Core 1.0 if you want to compile all code in another platform since
    all code are compatible with .NET Core 1.0.
