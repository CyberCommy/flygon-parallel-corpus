- en: The first commercially released Android device was the **HTC Dream**. In 2008,
    this mobile phone introduced a new Linux-based operating system, Android. Since
    then, thousands of manufacturers have been using Android for their devices. At
    first, Android became popular among mobile operating systems such as Symbian,
    Java ME, Blackberry, and iOS. New generation technology had a demand for a new,
    lightweight, user-friendly, and affordable operating system. Android fulfilled
    these requirements, and gained its momentum faster than Blackberry and other competing
    operating systems.

    holds 76% of the market share, which itself explains its success. With the passage
    of time, Android has expanded its territory from mobile to other useful hardware
    platforms like tablets, televisions, watches, consoles, and so on.

    games. The modern world has witnessed that games are now not just limited to PCs
    or consoles. They have become a part of almost everything. So, it is very important
    for Android game developers to have a decent knowledge of all possible hardware
    that might be useful for gaming, and which opens up opportunities for few more.

- en: Android mobile devices are the most important devices for game developers. Mobile
    technology has undergone a huge revolution during the last decade, from the black
    and white pixel phone to modern age smartphones. Currently, Android mobile devices
    are leading the market by a huge margin compared to its nearest competitor, the
    iPhone.

    1.6, followed by Android 2.3\. Even today, there are many devices running on Android
    2.3\. That is why many of the popular cross-platform gaming engines support Android
    2.3.

    of RAM, 32 MB of disk space, and a 200 MHz processor as well. If we take a look
    at current device specifications, a drastic change can be noticed. Nowadays, Android
    mobile devices have 1 GB RAM, 1 GHz processor, and 4 GB disk space on an average.
    Most of the devices have multicore processing units. However, this rise did not
    simplify the life of the game developer; on the contrary, it increased the complexity
    even more.

    game build cannot achieve best performance across all configurations. It is pretty
    obvious that if the game runs well on a Micromax Bolt A24 device, then it will
    surely underperform on the Samsung Galaxy S6\. By the word "underperform", we
    mean the quality of the game on Samsung Galaxy S6 would be far below expectations.
    So it is a very good line of thinking to have some idea on game portability. We
    will discuss this in detail later on.

    difference between an Android phone and an Android tablet is the physical size

    `mobile` and `wear`. Developers now have a project for both their handheld and
    wearable apps for which they can create activities, services, and custom layouts.
    The handheld app does most of the heavy lifting, such as network communications,
    intensive processing, or tasks that require long amounts of user interaction.
    When the app completes these operations, the application should notify the wearable
    of the results through notifications or by syncing and sending data to the wearable.

    This class inflates a layout based on whether the device's screen is round or
    square. The `WatchViewStub` class is one of the UI widgets that the wearable support
    library provides.

    contains the APIs to extend the existing notifications on handhelds to support
    wearables. For notifications that appear only on the wearable (meaning, they are
    issued by an app that runs on the wearable), the developer can just use the standard
    framework APIs (API level 20) on the wearable, and remove the support library
    dependency in the `mobile` module of the game or application.'

    UI widgets designed for wearables. The Android platform encourages developers
    to use them in applications, because they exemplify best practices, and yet they
    can change at any time. However, if the libraries are updated, the applications
    won''t break, since they are compiled into the project. To get new features from
    an updated library, developers just need to statically link the new version, and
    update the application accordingly. This library is only applicable if a developer
    creates wearable apps.'

    we already know that Android is not compatible with ARM v4 processors, and Android
    4.0+ requires ARM v7 or higher. Android wearables run on Android 4.4 or higher.
    So the developer must support ARM v7 onwards.

    and software specifications. In this chapter, you have learned about the possible
    different hardware platforms running on Android. Through this knowledge, you,
    as a developer, can easily identify your target audience. It is much easier to
    choose a specific set of hardware platforms to target.

    with different technologies. We will discuss these later in this book. Till now,
    you have come to know that mobiles, tablets, televisions, STBs, consoles, and
    watches are the various hardware platforms. All of them are capable of running
    Android games. However, Android consoles are the only dedicated hardware platform
    for games.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Though consoles are a dedicated gaming platform, Android mobiles and Android
    tablets are the most targeted platforms for developers. These provide all the
    necessary support and facilities to run almost every kind of game. These platforms
    have the added advantage of the number of users. Most developers target these
    platforms to acquire as many users as possible.
