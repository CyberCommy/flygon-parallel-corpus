- en: The first commercially released Android device was the **HTC Dream**. In 2008,
    this mobile phone introduced a new Linux-based operating system, Android. Since
    then, thousands of manufacturers have been using Android for their devices. At
    first, Android became popular among mobile operating systems such as Symbian,
    Java ME, Blackberry, and iOS. New generation technology had a demand for a new,
    lightweight, user-friendly, and affordable operating system. Android fulfilled
    these requirements, and gained its momentum faster than Blackberry and other competing
    operating systems.

    holds 76% of the market share, which itself explains its success. With the passage
    of time, Android has expanded its territory from mobile to other useful hardware
    platforms like tablets, televisions, watches, consoles, and so on.

    games. The modern world has witnessed that games are now not just limited to PCs
    or consoles. They have become a part of almost everything. So, it is very important
    for Android game developers to have a decent knowledge of all possible hardware
    that might be useful for gaming, and which opens up opportunities for few more.

    technology has undergone a huge revolution during the last decade, from the black

    1.6, followed by Android 2.3\. Even today, there are many devices running on Android
    2.3\. That is why many of the popular cross-platform gaming engines support Android

    of RAM, 32 MB of disk space, and a 200 MHz processor as well. If we take a look
    at current device specifications, a drastic change can be noticed. Nowadays, Android
    mobile devices have 1 GB RAM, 1 GHz processor, and 4 GB disk space on an average.
    Most of the devices have multicore processing units. However, this rise did not
    simplify the life of the game developer; on the contrary, it increased the complexity
    even more.

    game build cannot achieve best performance across all configurations. It is pretty
    obvious that if the game runs well on a Micromax Bolt A24 device, then it will
    surely underperform on the Samsung Galaxy S6\. By the word "underperform", we
    mean the quality of the game on Samsung Galaxy S6 would be far below expectations.
    So it is a very good line of thinking to have some idea on game portability. We
    will discuss this in detail later on.

    matters a lot. Low PPI screens cannot deliver a high quality display. The first-generation
    Android G1 mobile had a screen resolution of 240x320, falling in the LDPI resolution
    category. Hence, the visual quality of the game could not be excellent, no matter
    how hard the developer tried. Fortunately, with time, device manufacturers put
    in a lot of effort in to improving the visual quality along with performance.
    But this feature came with a price of battery life. The more quality it gained,
    the more battery it consumed.

    and software specifications. In this chapter, you have learned about the possible
    different hardware platforms running on Android. Through this knowledge, you,
    as a developer, can easily identify your target audience. It is much easier to
    choose a specific set of hardware platforms to target.

    with different technologies. We will discuss these later in this book. Till now,
    you have come to know that mobiles, tablets, televisions, STBs, consoles, and
    watches are the various hardware platforms. All of them are capable of running
    Android games. However, Android consoles are the only dedicated hardware platform
    for games.

    tablets are the most targeted platforms for developers. These provide all the
    necessary support and facilities to run almost every kind of game. These platforms
    have the added advantage of the number of users. Most developers target these
    platforms to acquire as many users as possible.
