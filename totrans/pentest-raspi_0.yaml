- en: The focus of this book is to learn how to combine the power of Kali Linux with
    the portability and low cost of a Raspberry Pi. The result is an extremely flexible
    penetration testing platform for specific projects that don't require applications
    with high processing power needs. We have used this toolset to conduct penetration
    and vulnerability testing from remote locations, used the portability of the Raspberry
    Pi to test security assessment covertly at different locations, and have configured
    the Raspberry Pi to be managed remotely with little footprint. Additionally, the
    low footprint and power consumption of the Raspberry Pi means that it is possible
    to run the device for a solid day or two on external battery pack USBs. Using
    Kali Linux on a Raspberry Pi can provide a penetration tester with a unique and
    cost-effective option to accomplish testing objectives.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The focus of this book is to turn a Raspberry Pi into a hacking arsenal by leveraging
    the most popular open source penetration toolset – Kali Linux. If you are looking
    for a low budget, small form-factor hacking tool that is remotely accessible,
    then the concepts in this book are ideal for you. If you are a penetration tester
    who wants to save on travel costs by placing a low-cost node on a target network,
    you will save thousands by using the methods covered in this book. If you are
    new to penetration testing and want to get hands on experience without spending
    a ton of money on expensive hardware, this book will help get you going. If you
    are a Raspberry Pi enthusiast who is interested in hacking, this book has you
    covered. You do not have to be a skilled hacker or programmer to use this book.
    It will be beneficial to have some networking experience; however, it is not required
    to follow the concepts covered in this book.
