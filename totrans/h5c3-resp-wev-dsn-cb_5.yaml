    By this, we mean first designing your site for the mobile device, and then applying
    variation or even a wholly different look for the desktop. We'll cover a few recipes
    on jQuery Mobile, a free and open source library of mobile UI elements and widgets.
    In addition, we'll build some client-side scripting to handle a unique look only
    for mobile devices.

- en: For developing mobile-first applications, you will need to deploy them locally
    and test the various features you have developed. Many of the responsive web recipes
    we have worked on so far relied on media queries to determine layout based on
    size to deliver the optimized view of your site. This is not the only way in which
    apps can deliver mobile layout, there are more. One method is, by sniffing the
    **user agent**.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You may already know about the user agent, but let's assume you don't. Besides,
    knowing everything already simply defeats the purpose of buying the book, now
    doesn't it? The user agent exists in the request header and identifies the client
    software making the request. It contains information about your processor, operating
    system version, browser, rendering engine, IP address, and other identifying information.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: According to the needs of the project or the preference of the developer, some
    websites are designed to display different template files for mobile devices,
    or based on other details of the user agent data. This method requires a different
    server or client intelligence to read the user agent and interpret its data to
    deliver the presentation for that scenario.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So you've created a new web application, and the software displays the mobile
    template when the user agent details a mobile device. However, you want to be
    able to test it on the fly and not have to spin up a web server, so the next best
    thing is to use the user agent masking feature in Safari.

    does it mimic the user agent of the mobile Safari browser on iOS devices, but
    it also mimics the user agent of the Android browsers. So you can be at peace

    The browser gave the server information about your computer and browser, and it

    admit it, it is. But here is one of the few cases where the ends genuinely justify
    the means. Besides, there's no harm done; it's not like the server figures out
    that your browser was lying to it and feels deceived and hurt. Masking your user
    agent gives you the power to convince the web server that your desktop browser
    is really a mobile browser. If the server believes you are using a mobile browser
    and its logic dictates that it should deliver a mobile version, then that's what
    you will get.

    will read the device width and set that as the page width. Setting a specific

    user experience of a web page on a mobile device is very different from that of
    the one on a desktop. On the old desktop Web, it was often said, "Content is king";
    now that the Web is mobile, there is limited space, and it's easy for all that
    content to become too much content. You may want to consider limiting some of
    what is displayed on each page. In this recipe, we will use jQuery Mobile to divide
    a large page with lots of data into smaller digestible bits.

    JavaScript and additionally execute functions on its successful loading.
