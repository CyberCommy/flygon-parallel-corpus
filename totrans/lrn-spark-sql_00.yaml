- en: We will start this book with the basics of Spark  SQL and its role in Spark
    applications. After the initial familiarization with Spark SQL, we will focus
    on using Spark SQL to execute tasks that are common to all big data projects,
    such as working with various types of data sources, exploratory data analysis,
    and data munging. We will also see how Spark SQL and SparkR can be leveraged to
    accomplish typical data science tasks at scale.

- en: With the DataFrame/Dataset API and the Catalyst optimizer at the heart of Spark
    SQL, it is no surprise that it plays a key role in all applications based on the
    Spark technology stack. These applications include large-scale machine learning
    pipelines, large-scale graph applications, and emerging Spark-based deep learning
    applications. Additionally, we will present Spark SQL-based Structured Streaming
    applications that are deployed in complex production environments as continuous
    applications.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We will also review performance tuning in Spark SQL applications, including
    **cost-based optimization** (**CBO**) introduced in Spark 2.2\. Finally, we will
    present application architectures that leverage Spark modules and Spark SQL in
    real-world applications. More specifically, we will cover key architectural components
    and patterns in large-scale Spark applications that architects and designers will
    find useful as building blocks for their own specific use cases.

- en: This book is based on Spark 2.2.0 (pre-built for Apache Hadoop 2.7 or later)
    and Scala 2.11.8\. For one or two subsections, Spark 2.1.0 has also been used
    due to the unavailability of certain libraries and reported bugs (when used with
    Apache Spark 2.2). The hardware and OS specifications include minimum 8 GB RAM
    (16 GB strongly recommended), 100 GB HDD, and OS X 10.11.6 or later (or appropriate
    Linux versions recommended for Spark development).
