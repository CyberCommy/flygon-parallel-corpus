- en: Docker containers promise to radically change the way developers and operations
    build, deploy, and manage applications running on the cloud. Kubernetes provides
    the orchestration tools you need to realize that promise in production.

- en: Kubernetes on AWS guides you in deploying a production-ready Kubernetes cluster
    on the **Amazon Web Services** (**AWS**) platform. You will discover how to use
    the power of Kubernetes, which is one of the fastest growing platforms for production-based
    container orchestration, to manage and update your applications. Kubernetes is
    becoming the go-to choice for production-grade deployments of cloud-native applications.
    This book covers Kubernetes from first principles. You will start by learning
    about Kubernetes' powerful abstractions—pods and services—which make managing
    container deployments easy. This will be followed by a guided tour through setting
    up a production-ready Kubernetes cluster on AWS, while learning the techniques
    you need to successfully deploy and manage your own applications.

    Kubernetes on AWS. You will also have picked up some tips on deploying and managing
    applications, keeping your cluster and applications secure, and ensuring that
    your whole system is reliable and resilient to failure.

- en: If you're a cloud engineer, cloud solution provider, sysadmin, site reliability
    engineer, or developer with an interest in DevOps and are looking for an extensive
    guide to running Kubernetes in the AWS environment, this book is for you. Though
    any previous knowledge of Kubernetes is not expected, some experience with Linux
    and Docker containers would be a bonus.
