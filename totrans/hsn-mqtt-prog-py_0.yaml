- en: MQTT is the preferred IoT publish-subscribe lightweight messaging protocol.
    Python is definitely one of the most popular programming languages. It is open
    source, multiplatform, and you can use it to develop any kind of application.
    If you develop IoT, web applications, mobile apps, or a combination of these solutions,
    you must learn how MQTT and its lightweight messaging system works. The combination
    of Python and MQTT makes it possible to develop powerful applications that communicate
    with sensors, different devices, and other applications. Of course, it is extremely
    important to take security into account when working with this protocol.

- en: Most of the time, when you work with complex IoT solutions coded in modern Python
    3.6, you will use different IoT boards that might use diverse operating systems.
    MQTT has its own specific vocabulary and different working modes. Learning MQTT
    is challenging, because it includes too many abstract concepts that require real-life
    examples to be easy to understand.

    protocol: 3.1.1\. You will learn to work with the most recent Mosquitto MQTT server,
    command-line tools, and GUI tools to allow you to understand how everything works
    with MQTT and the possibilities that this protocol provides for your projects.
    You will learn security best practices and use them for a Mosquitto MQTT server.'

- en: Then, you will work with many real-life examples in Python 3.6\. You will control
    a vehicle, process commands, interact with actuators, and monitor a surf competition
    by exchanging MQTT messages with the Eclipse Paho MQTT client library. You will
    also work with a cloud-based, real-time MQTT provider.

- en: You will be able to run the examples on a wide range of modern IoT boards, such
    as Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+, Qualcomm DragonBoard 410c, BeagleBone Black, MinnowBoard
    Turbot Quad-Core, LattePanda 2G, and UP Core 4GB. However, any other board that
    supports Python 3.6 will be able to run the samples.

- en: '[Chapter 1](d20ae00b-2bb7-4d81-b3eb-5c47215bce1f.xhtml), *Installing an MQTT
    3.1.1 Mosquitto Server*, starts our journey toward the usage of the preferred
    IoT publish-subscribe lightweight messaging protocol in diverse IoT solutions,
    combined with mobile apps and web applications. We will learn how MQTT and its
    lightweight messaging system work. We will understand the MQTT puzzle: clients,
    servers (formerly known as brokers), and connections. We will learn the procedures
    to install an MQTT 3.1.1 Mosquitto server in Linux, macOS, and Windows. We will
    learn special considerations for running a Mosquitto server on the Cloud (Azure,
    AWS, and other cloud providers).'

    and GUI Tools to Learn How MQTT Works*, teaches us to work with command-line and
    GUI tools to learn how MQTT works in detail. We will learn MQTT basics, the specific
    vocabulary for MQTT, and its working modes. We will use different utilities and
    diagrams to understand the most important concepts related to MQTT. We will understand
    everything we need to know before writing Python code to work with the MQTT protocol.
    We will work with the different Quality of Service levels, and we will analyze
    and compare their overheads.'

    3.1.1 Mosquitto Server*, focuses on how to secure an MQTT 3.1.1 Mosquitto server.
    We will make all the necessary configurations to work with digital certificates
    to encrypt all the data sent between the MQTT clients and the server. We will
    use TLS, and we will learn to work with client certificates for each MQTT client.
    We will also learn to force the desired TLS protocol version.'

    a Vehicle with Python and MQTT Messages*, focuses on writing Python 3.x code to
    control a vehicle with MQTT messages delivered through encrypted connections (TLS
    1.2). We will write code that will be able to run on different popular IoT platforms,
    such as a Raspberry Pi 3 board. We will understand how we can leverage our knowledge
    of the MQTT protocol to build a solution based on requirements. We will learn
    to work with the latest version of the Eclipse Paho MQTT Python client library.'

    with MQTT messages and Python code. We will learn how to process commands received
    in MQTT messages with Python code. We will write Python code to compose and send
    MQTT messages with commands. We will work with the blocking and threaded network
    loops, and we will understand the difference between them. Finally, we will take
    advantage of the last will and testament feature.'

    Competition with Cloud-Based Real-Time MQTT Providers and Python*, gets you started
    with writing Python code to use the PubNub cloud-based, real-time MQTT provider
    in combination with a Mosquitto MQTT server to monitor a surfing competition.
    We will build a solution from scratch by analyzing the requirements, and we will
    write Python code that will run on waterproof IoT boards connected to multiple
    sensors in surfboards. We will define the topics and commands, and we will work
    with a cloud-based MQTT server, in combination with the Mosquitto MQTT server
    used in the previous chapters.'
