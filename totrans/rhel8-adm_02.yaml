    is to have it running. Whether in your own laptop as the main system, in a virtual
    machine, or in a physical server, its installation is necessary in order to get
    your hands on the system you want to learn to use. It is highly encouraged that
    you get yourself a physical or virtual machine to use the system while reading
    this book.

    this emulated computer on your own laptop, in case you are using macOS or Windows,
    you will need to install virtualization software such as Virtual Box, for example.
    If you are already running Linux, it is already prepared for virtualization, and
    you will only need to add the `virt-manager` package.

    (or remove the USB thumb drive from the server) and check that the boot order
    is properly configured in the system.

    and have it ready to be used for any service we want to run in it. In the cloud,
    the process is very different as machines are instantiated from images to run.
    In the next chapter, we will review how to run RHEL in a virtual machine instance
    in the cloud.

    on real-world experience. The best way to prepare for it is by practicing as much
    as possible, which is why this book begins by providing access to *Red Hat Enterprise
    Linux 8* (RHEL8) and offering alternatives on how to deploy your own virtual machine.

    ones, and include using a physical machine, a virtual machine, or a cloud instance.
    In this chapter, we focused on using a virtual machine or a physical one.

    like to reuse old hardware, buy second-hand or cheap mini servers, or even use
    their laptop as the primary installation for their Linux experience.

    to keep all their work on the same laptop, but without messing with their current
    operating system (which may not even be Linux). This could also work well with
    the previous option by having virtual machines on your own mini server.
