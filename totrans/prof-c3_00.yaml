- en: CSS is often perceived as a simple language. In fact, while being declarative
    and apparently simple, it is pretty hard to maintain. For a growing large-scale
    web application, maintainability is crucial. This book is about ways to leverage
    known tricks and hacks, new CSS level 3 module techniques, preprocessors, and
    other tools to create really high-quality products. This will include examples
    on techniques such as float handling and component-based CSS.
