- en: Storm, initially a project from the house of Twitter, has graduated to the league
    of Apache and thus rechristened from Twitter Storm. It is the brainchild of Nathan
    Marz that's now adopted by leagues of Cloudera's Distribution Including Apache
    Hadoop (CDH) and the Hortonworks Data Platform (HDP), and so on.

- en: Apache Storm is a highly scalable, distributed, fast, and reliable real-time
    computing system designed to process very high velocity data. Cassandra complements
    the computing capability by providing lightning-fast read and writes, and this
    is the best combination currently available for data storage with Storm.

- en: The combination of the Storm computing and Cassandra storage is helping technology
    evangelists to solve various business problems involving complex and high data
    volume situations such as real-time customer service, dashboards, security, sensor
    data analysis, data monetization, and so on.
