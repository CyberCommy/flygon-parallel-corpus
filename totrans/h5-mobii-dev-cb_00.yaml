- en: A text editor is all that is needed for most recipes in the book. You should
    also have a mobile device such as an iPhone, Android, Blackberry, or other device
    suitable for testing. Although it is best to test things out on a real device,
    don't worry if you don't have one, because we will cover details on how to use
    emulators and simulators to test, in case a real device is not available.
