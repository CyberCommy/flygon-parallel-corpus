- en: Microsoft Windows is one of the two most common OS and managing its security
    has spawned the discipline of IT security. Kali Linux is the premier platform
    for testing and maintaining Windows security. Kali is built on the Debian distribution
    of Linux and shares the legendary stability of that OS. This lets you focus on
    using the network penetration, password cracking, forensics tools and not the
    OS.

    used by sophisticated hackers to make you an expert in Kali Linux penetration
    testing. You will start by learning about the various desktop environments that

    the Windows protocols in use on the network. You will see several tools to improve
    your average in password acquisition from hash-cracking, online attacks, offline
    attacks, and rainbow tables to social engineering. It also demonstrates several
