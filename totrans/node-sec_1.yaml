    step from the renaissance that client-side JavaScript has experienced over the
    last few years. While Node.js is not the first server-side JavaScript implementation,
    it has certainly become the most popular. By leveraging the best features of JavaScript
    as a language and nurturing a vibrant community, Node.js has become a tremendously
    popular platform and framework, with no signs of slowing down. A great description
    of what Node is can be found at [http://nodejs.org/](http://nodejs.org/):'

    I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient, perfect for data-intensive
    real-time applications that run across distributed devices.

- en: The project began as the brain-child of Ryan Dahl back in 2009\. At JSConf.eu
    (a conference held annually in Europe) that year, he made his presentation and
    changed the face of JavaScript development. His speech included an impressive
    demonstration of a complete IRC server that had been written in roughly 400 lines
    of JavaScript. During his presentation, he outlined why he started the project,
    why JavaScript became such an integral part of it, and what goals he sought to
    accomplish along the way in the field of server programming – particularly with
    regards to how we deal with input and output (I/O).

    for Node.js applications, as well as creating a publicly available registry for
    sharing code between Node.js developers. As of version 0.6.3 of Node.js, npm is
    deployed and installed alongside Node.js, making it the de facto package manager.

- en: When writing an application server, a program like this can only serve one user
    at a time, and the next user cannot be served until all the I/O and processing
    is complete for the previous user. This is unacceptable of course, so the easiest
    solution is to create a new thread for each incoming request, so they can run
    in parallel.

- en: This is how the **Apache** web server works, and it is not difficult to implement.
    However, as the number of simultaneous users increase, the amount of memory used
    also increases. Each of those threads requires overhead at the operating system
    level, and it adds up pretty quickly. In addition, the overhead of context switching
    between those threads is more time consuming than desired, further compounding
    the problem.
  id: totrans-25

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 这就是**Apache**网页服务器的工作原理，实现起来并不困难。然而，随着同时用户数量的增加，内存使用量也会增加。每个线程都需要操作系统级别的开销，并且这些开销会迅速累积。此外，在这些线程之间进行上下文切换的开销比预期的更加耗时，进一步加剧了问题。
- en: The **nginx** web server uses an event loop at its core to handle processes.
    By doing so, it is able to handle more simultaneous users at once, with fewer
    resources. An event loop requires that the bits of processing be broken up into
    small pieces, and run in a single queue. This removes the high cost of creating
    threads, switching back and forth between those threads, and requires less demand
    of the overall system. At the same time, it fills in the processing gaps, particularly
    those that occur during the wait for I/O to complete.
  id: totrans-26
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: '**nginx**网页服务器使用事件循环来处理进程。通过这样做，它能够同时处理更多的用户，使用更少的资源。事件循环要求将处理的位分解成小块，并在一个单一队列中运行。这消除了创建线程的高成本，来回切换线程之间的开销，并减少了对整个系统的需求。同时，它填补了处理间隙，特别是在等待I/O完成时发生的间隙。'
- en: Node.js takes the event-driven model that nginx uses to such great success,
    and it exposes that same capability for many types of applications. In Node.js,
    all I/O is entirely asynchronous and does not block the rest of the application
    thread. The Node.js API accepts function parameters (usually known as a "callback
    function") for all I/O operations. Node.js then fires off that I/O operation,
    and lets another thread outside the application do the processing. After that,
    the application is free to continue handling other requests. Once the requested
    operation is complete, the event-loop is notified, and the callback function is
    invoked with the results.
  id: totrans-27
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: Node.js采用了nginx成功使用的事件驱动模型，并为许多类型的应用程序提供了相同的能力。在Node.js中，所有I/O都是完全异步的，不会阻塞应用程序的其他线程。Node.js
    API接受函数参数（通常称为“回调函数”）进行所有I/O操作。然后Node.js启动该I/O操作，并让应用程序外的另一个线程进行处理。完成请求的操作后，事件循环被通知，回调函数被调用并返回结果。
- en: As it turns out, waiting for I/O to complete is the most expensive part of many
    applications in terms of raw processing time. With Node.js, the time spent waiting
    for I/O is completely detached from the rest of your application's processing
    time. Your application just uses callback functions to process results as simple
    events, and JavaScript's ability to use closure retains the function's context,
    despite being executed asynchronously.
  id: totrans-28
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 事实证明，等待I/O完成是许多应用程序在原始处理时间方面最昂贵的部分。使用Node.js，等待I/O的时间完全与应用程序的其余处理时间分离。你的应用程序只是使用回调函数来处理结果作为简单的事件，并且JavaScript的闭包能力保留了函数的上下文，尽管是异步执行的。
- en: If you were to take up the task of writing a multi-threaded application, you
    would have to concern yourself with concurrency problems like deadlocks, which
    are very difficult (if not impossible) to reproduce and debug in real-world applications.
    With Node.js, your primary application logic runs on a single thread, free of
    such concurrency problems, while the time-consuming I/O is handled on your behalf
    by Node.js.
  id: totrans-29
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 如果你要写一个多线程应用程序，你将不得不关注并发问题，比如死锁，这在真实应用程序中很难（甚至不可能）重现和调试。使用Node.js，你的主要应用逻辑在单个线程上运行，不会出现这样的并发问题，而耗时的I/O则由Node.js代表你处理。
- en: Like any other platform, Node.js has an API developers can use to write their
    applications. JavaScript itself lacks a standard library, particularly for performing
    I/O. This actually turned out to be one of the reasons that Ryan Dahl chose JavaScript.
    As the core API can be built from the ground up, without needing to worry about
    creating conflicts with a standard library, in case it is done wrong (given JavaScript's
    history, this is not an unreasonable assumption).
  id: totrans-30
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 和其他平台一样，Node.js有一个API供开发者编写他们的应用程序使用。JavaScript本身缺乏标准库，特别是用于执行I/O。这实际上成为Ryan
    Dahl选择JavaScript的原因之一。因为核心API可以从头开始构建，而不需要担心与标准库发生冲突，如果做错了（考虑到JavaScript的历史，这并不是一个不合理的假设）。
- en: 'That core library is minimalistic, but it does include modules for the essentials.
    This includes, but is not limited to: filesystem access, network communication,
    events, binary data structures, and streams. Many of these APIs, while not difficult
    to use, are very low-level in implementation. Consider this "Hello World" demonstration
    straight from the Node.js website (with comments added):'

  zh: 那个核心库是最小化的，但它包括了基本的模块。这包括但不限于：文件系统访问、网络通信、事件、二进制数据结构和流。其中许多API虽然不难使用，但在实现上非常底层。考虑一下这个直接来自Node.js网站的“Hello
    World”演示（附加了注释）：

  zh: 这个服务器使用**http**核心模块来建立一个简单的网页服务器，向任何请求它的人发送“Hello World”。这是一个简单的例子，但没有注释的话，总共只有六行代码。
- en: The Node.js team has opted to keep the core library limited in scope, leaving
    the community of developers to create the modules they need for everything else,
    such as database drivers, unit-testing, templating, and abstractions for the core
    API. To aid in this process, Node.js has a package manager called npm.
  id: totrans-34
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: Node.js团队选择保持核心库的范围有限，让开发者社区为其他所有内容创建他们所需的模块，比如数据库驱动程序、单元测试、模板和核心API的抽象。为了帮助这个过程，Node.js有一个叫做npm的包管理器。
- en: npm is the tool that handles installing dependencies for Node.js applications.
    It opts for locally bundled dependencies, rather than using a single global namespace.
    This allows different projects to have their own dependencies, even if the version
    varies between those projects.

  zh: npm是处理Node.js应用程序安装依赖项的工具。它选择本地捆绑的依赖项，而不是使用单一的全局命名空间。这允许不同的项目拥有自己的依赖项，即使这些项目之间的版本不同。
