    use to learn programming. At least that was its initial goal. As we will see in

    processor and 256 MB of RAM. The Raspberry Pi 2 was released in February of 2015
    with a 900 MHz quad core processor and 1 GB of RAM. Released in February of 2016,
    the Raspberry Pi 3 increased the processor speed to 1.2 GHz. This model was also
    the first one to include wireless LAN and Bluetooth.
