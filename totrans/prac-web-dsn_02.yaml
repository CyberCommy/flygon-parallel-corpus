    Design* we looked at how web design has evolved since the first web page of Sir
    Tim Berners-Lee in 1990\. Throughout those years, we saw new elements and styles
    emerging in website design. Some elements will help the user navigate through
    the website, some will help tell a story, but most importantly, all of them have
    the potential to improve the visitor's experience. In this chapter, I will help
    you understand each component, its usage, and why it's useful. Let's dive into
    it!

    with Responsive design, but their use does not stop there. Designers have used
    grids since print design, for books, publications, and especially magazines. To
    simply define it, a grid system is a system that helps designers structure their
    design, content, and imagery, and make it more readable and manageable.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are always advantages and disadvantages on everything, and the grids don't
    escape that rule. The first disadvantage of grids for most people and especially
    those who are new to design is that they may feel the grid system can be a little
    restrictive and repetitive creatively. Totally understandable and unfortunately,
    it happens from time to time that you feel like it's difficult to think outside
    the box and it can feel like you are creating the same thing again and again.
    But keep in mind that the grid is not easy to take over and needs practice and
    experience to fully use it to its advantage.

- en: A **Call to Action** (**CTA**) is a marketing term to define a designed element
    that solicits and encourages an action from the user and which the end goal is
    to attempt a sale. You'll hear a lot of this term when you start working as a
    designer when designing websites, especially for marketing purposes. The goal
    of every designer is to maximize the click conversion on this button, which leads
    to a sale at the end. Here is some indication of good practice when designing
    your CTA.

    because it remains a button, and people are used to it. As users have become accustomed
    to the online experience, they know that CTAs come in the forms of buttons. They
    see a button; they know what to do. Simple. Make it big, obvious, and stand out
    from everything around it, and it's in the bag.

    when you view a color, your eyes communicate with a region of the brain known
    as the hypothalamus, then, in turn, it will send a signal to the pituitary gland
    and finally to the thyroid gland. This signals the release of hormones that cause
    fluctuation in mood, emotion, and resulting in behavior. Interesting, isn't it?

    a site visitor to form a judgment or opinion. Further to that, 62-90% of that
    interaction is determined by the color of a product alone.

    know they are always in the same place, you don't have to think. But if you don't
    find it, you'll start to stress out trying to find it. Websites are the same for

    How the website is responding to a user's interaction should always be consistent

    is always situated in the top-left position so that the user doesn't have to look
