- en: Easy-to-understand and impressive reporting is the key to a successful Vulnerability
    Assessment. It is very important to understand who the target audience is before
    you write a Vulnerability Assessment report. Most of the time, a Vulnerability
    Assessment report will be read by different groups and by audiences at varying
    levels of proficiency. Some of them may have very strong knowledge about technical
    terms and some may not understand anything technical; hence, it's important that
    the report have the right mix of material that addresses both technical and non-technical
    audiences. It is important to generate a comprehensive Vulnerability Assessment
    report to make others aware of the vulnerabilities found in the text format so
    that it is easy to understand for the target readers.

    Vulnerability Assessment reports are distributed to different teams in a big enterprise,

- en: A management professional is not interested in looking into the details of each
    vulnerability. They would rather see a summary of the assessment with a quick
    screenshot of the number of vulnerabilities that have been identified, categorized
    by their severity; this can be better captured in a graphical representation along
    with some text around the section showing critical/high/medium/low severity vulnerabilities.
    On the other hand, a technical person would like to see more technical details
    about the vulnerability report and a step-by-step procedure, in case it is a penetration
    testing report; this will help them reproduce the vulnerability. A technical person
    would also like to receive recommendations on how to fix the vulnerability.

    each vulnerability. Depending on the audience, the report can be customized. It
    is recommended to choose and apply appropriate filters to decide on report content
    if you perform the scan very often and want to produce the report in the same
    format each time. Security consultants may not want to do that since they get
    different reporting requirements from different clients.

- en: In the previous section, we learned that the Nessus report captures a lot of
    details about each vulnerability report. At times, when you are engaged as a consultant
    for a Vulnerability Assessment report, you may not want to use the report generated
    by Nessus to share with the client since it has a lot of details about each vulnerability;
    this can be well understood by and useful for a security consultant, but not for
    an end customer who just needs to understand what the vulnerability is and what
    needs to be done to fix it. Another case may be that you want to showcase the
    report in a different format provided by the client; for that, you need to customize
    the report accordingly.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It is completely up to you what parameters you want to include in your Vulnerability
    Assessment report. A default report generated by Nessus is pretty good and comprehensive.
    It might happen that you also need to see ease of exploit in the report or maybe
    the effort required to fix the vulnerability. What to include and what not to
    include in the vulnerability report is totally up to the person who creates the
    report and the organization's requirement. You are required to customize the reports
    accordingly.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Customization can be done by removing specific fields from the default Nessus
    report and adding extra fields into it that you need in addition to the default
    fields. If you are required to create the report in the Microsoft Word format,
    you can copy and paste from the default reports generated by Nessus.

- en: The report automation section is not specific to Nessus; in general, the multiple
    Vulnerability Assessment tools available in the market and their older versions
    don't support the generation of reports in the Microsoft Excel or PDF formats.
    In order to make the most out of those autogenerated reports and to conform them
    with organizations' preferred reporting formats, mostly Excel or Word, scripts
    can be written to convert those default reports to generate reports for our own
    needs.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One other need for Nessus reports' automation is that while you integrate Nessus
    reports using different tools, such as Archer and Agiliance, which are governance
    risk and compliance tools; the security information and event management tool;
    or any other tools available in your organization using which you want Nessus
    to generate Vulnerability Assessment results. In these cases, for integration,
    every tool has certain prerequisite formats for reports. Most tools accept CSV
    formats. In order to convert reports to the desired formats, I recommend writing
    scripts.

    Assessment report should be customized to suit the audience of the report, ranging
    from higher management to technical teams working on the closure of vulnerabilities.
    After completing the scan, the output is available under the **Result** tab in
    Nessus. Under this tab, we have the summary of hosts, the vulnerabilities found,
    and an option to export the results.
  prefs: []

    Nessus offers five options to decide on the content to be included, namely **Hosts
    Summary (Executive)**, **Vulnerabilities by Host**, **Compliance Checks**, **Vulnerabilities
    By Plugin**, and **Compliance Checks (Executive)**. The **Result** tab also has
    a filtering option where the drop-down menu filters the required class and types
