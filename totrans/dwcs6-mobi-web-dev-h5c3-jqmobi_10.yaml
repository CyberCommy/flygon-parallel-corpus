    an app does not run in a browser. Instead, an app functions as a standalone program
    that runs in a mobile device operating system. Freed from the constraints of running
    in a browser, apps can take advantage of the entire viewport of a mobile device.
    Also, apps can run on a mobile device even when the device is not connected to
    the Internet.

    are very different "under the hood." Apps are written in high-level programming
    languages, while mobile-friendly sites can be created with HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript
    (the three components of jQuery Mobile).

    Mobile site into an app. Those app-generating tools are still in their early evolutionary
    stages. In fact, the features for generating apps in Dreamweaver CS6 have been
    scaled down a bit from those that were available in Dreamweaver 5.5\. Nonetheless,
    you can generate real, working apps in Dreamweaver; and in this chapter, we will
    walk through how to do that.

    full-fledged software programs. One major implication of this is that apps need
    to work on a specific operating system. Dreamweaver, for example, is an app (application).
    Dreamweaver runs on two operating systems: Microsoft Windows and Apple''s OS X
    operating system. And again, apps are specific to an operating system, so you
    can''t run the Windows version of Dreamweaver on a Mac (nor can you run the Mac
    version of Dreamweaver on a Windows machine). And neither the Mac nor the Windows
    version of Dreamweaver runs on a Linux machine.'

    operating system. Android is open source—meaning that anyone can access the source
    code. And Google's approach has been to encourage mobile manufacturers to use
    Android as the operating system on their devices. At this point in the development
    of mobile devices, the Android operating system is found on a very wide array
    of mobile devices, from Amazon's Kindle Fire, Samsung's tablets and smart phones,
    and low-cost smart phones available for as little as $39\. Android is the most

    by clicking on the **Emulate Application** icon for your app. The app will need
    to be uploaded and regenerated, which takes substantial time—this emphasizes the
    importance of testing and perfecting your jQuery Mobile site before you generate
    apps.

    extension) onto your mobile device. You can then launch the app on your mobile
    device the same way you would launch any app.

    through Google Play, but there are requirements, and you do have to register as
    an Android developer (and pay a registration fee). You'll find all the information

    to work on a mobile device, nor do they require an Internet connection (once they

    Those tools convert web pages built with HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript (generally
    speaking, that means jQuery Mobile pages in Dreamweaver) into apps for a range
    of mobile operating systems including Android. If you are a registered Apple developer,
    you can use PhoneGap and Dreamweaver to create Apple iOS apps as well.

- en: Do Dreamweaver CS6's app tools rise to the level of creating commercially-distributed
    apps sold through Google Play or iTunes? Probably not. Apps built by professional
    coders will load more quickly, run faster, can include 3D graphics, and most importantly,
    can be customized for different operating systems (whereas PhoneGap generates
    apps for every operating system based on the same source files). But the apps
    you build in Dreamweaver work well enough to be distributed for free. And if you
    elect to contract with a professional coder to create a commercial-quality app,
    you can use your PhoneGap-generated app as a model for your coding team to work
    from.

  zh: Dreamweaver CS6的应用程序工具是否能够达到通过Google Play或iTunes销售的商业分发应用程序的水平？可能不会。由专业编码人员构建的应用程序将加载更快，运行更快，可以包含3D图形，最重要的是，可以针对不同的操作系统进行定制（而PhoneGap基于相同的源文件为每个操作系统生成应用程序）。但是，在Dreamweaver中构建的应用程序足够好，可以免费分发。如果您选择与专业编码人员合作创建商业质量的应用程序，您可以使用PhoneGap生成的应用程序作为编码团队的工作模型。
