- en: Usually, the first question I get when I mention Docker or this book is *What
    is Docker?* So, we might as well answer that question right now and get it out
    of the way...

- en: Within the circle of friends I hang out with, I would answer that question by
    saying *Docker is a software solution used to build, ship, and run containers
    anywhere*. But if you are not a computer person, then that answer would mean next
    to nothing to you. So, let's try again, and answer the question *What is Docker?*
    in a way that is worthy of a Quick Start Guide.

- en: Docker is a tool that allows software developers to easily create applications,
    and wrap those applications in a special package called a **container**. Used
    correctly, an application packaged as a container can be run very efficiently,
    and very securely. And since the container has everything the application needs
    to run, it also allows the developer to share their application nearly anywhere,
    without ever having to re-create or re-package it.

- en: This means that as a result of using Docker, a developer can create, run, and
    test their application container on their own laptop and then share the exact
    same container with their peers so that it can be run and tested by them as well.
    Then, they can share the same container with the quality assurance team for further
    validation of quality, and ultimately, the exact same container can be run and
    used by customers in a production setting.

    can be tested and deployed faster than ever before.

- en: Within the pages of this book, you are going to find all of the information
    that you need to understand what Docker is and what benefits Docker provides.
    Using detailed, yet easy-to-follow, descriptions and examples, this Quick Start
    Guide will teach you how to set up your own Docker development environment, and
    how to create enterprise-grade Docker images that utilize all of the important
    features that Docker provides. This Quick Start Guide will teach you how to use
    Docker networking and Docker's storage features. You will also learn how to create
    and deploy multi-container applications, and how to set up Docker clustering using
    Docker Swarm. By the time you finish the Quick Start Guide, you will be building
    and sharing your own Docker images, and running your most important applications
    in Docker containers. This Quick Start Guide will thoroughly prepare you to use
    Docker for all of your future projects. If you are ready to get started, turn
    the page...

- en: This Quick Start Guide is written for anyone who wants to know what Docker is
    and understand why so many people are so excited about using it. It is intended
    for developers who want to get started using Docker right away and don't have
    time to wade through a full *Mastering Docker* book, or attend a week-long training
    course. This guide is for anyone who needs to make a quick decision about using
    Docker for their next project and get started right away.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You should have a developer workstation that you can install Docker on and use
    to test out the examples included in this book. You will learn the most by actually
    trying each of the examples yourself instead of just reading over them. In addition,
    you should have access to at least one other, but preferably two or three other,
    servers to configure as a Docker swarm. These servers can be EC2 instances in
    AWS; or VMs on VMware Workstation or Fusion; or, worst case scenario, VMs in VirtualBox.
    All of the software used throughout this book is free or open source, so you should
    be able to try out everything you are learning here. Most of the examples will
    work equally well regardless of the OS you are using, and I have tried to call
    out the differences where appropriate. You should have an account created on [https://hub.docker.com](https://hub.docker.com),
    and an account on [https://github.com](https://github.com). All of the code samples
    have been tested by me, as well as by several reviewers, so if you don't get them
    to work, double-check the code and try again, or download the code from Packt
    and cut and paste it into your system, and then try again. You'll get the hang
    of it.
