- en: Node.js is simply a tool that lets you use JavaScript on the server side. However,
    it actually does much more than that – by extending JavaScript, it allows for
    a much more integrated and efficient approach to development. It comes as no surprise
    that it's a fundamental tool for full-stack JavaScript developers. Whether you
    work on the backend or frontend, you adopt a much more collaborative and agile
    way of working using Node.js, so that you and your team can focus on delivering
    a quality end product. This will ensure that you're ready to take on any new challenge
    that gets thrown at you.
