- en: In Part 1 we focused on patterns originally identified in the GoF book that
    were the original impetus behind patterns in software design. In this part of
    the module we'll expand beyond those patterns to look at patterns that are related
    to functional programming, large-scale patterns for structuring an entire application,
    patterns which are specific to the Web, and messaging patterns. In addition, we'll
    look at patterns for testing and some rather interesting advanced patterns. Finally,
    we'll look at how we can get many of the features of the next version of JavaScript
    today.
