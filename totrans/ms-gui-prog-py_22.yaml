- en: In [Chapter 15](77583d1b-8a70-4118-8210-b0a5f09c9603.xhtml), *PyQt Raspberry
    Pi*, Raspbian 10 is required so that you can have a sufficiently recent version
    of Python and PyQt5\. At the time of publication, the current release of Raspbian
    is version 9, with version 10 expected in mid-to-late 2019\. You can, however,
    upgrade to the testing version of Raspbian 10, which will work correctly for the
    purposes of this book.

    complete, as it will need to download an updated copy of every package on the
    system and install it. After the download phase ends, there will be some questions
    to answer as well. Generally speaking, take the default answer for these questions.
