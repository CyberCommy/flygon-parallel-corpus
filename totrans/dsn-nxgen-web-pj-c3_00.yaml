- en: You'll be surprised, but CSS3 doesn't exist. Actually, this term is used to
    group a wide number of different specifications (see the the list at [http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/current-work](http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/current-work)),
    each of them with its own working team and completion state. Some are still Working
    Drafts while others are already Candidate Recommendations.

- en: This book tries to present you with a snapshot of what can be done today with
    this technology. It is organized into 10 projects, each of them relying heavily
    on some of the new CSS features such as background gradients, Flexible Box Layout,
    or CSS filters.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: All the projects have been developed and tested to work on the latest Chrome
    and Firefox browsers. The vast majority of them render and behave well even on
    Internet Explorer 10.

- en: Wherever possible, a workaround to make things work even on older browsers is
    provided. In this way, different techniques and tools are introduced, such as
    feature detection with Modernizr, graceful degradation, fallback properties triggered
    with conditional comments, and a bunch of quality polyfill libraries.

- en: The book also focuses on different kinds of tools, that are aimed at helping
    us while developing rather complex CSS documents. I'm talking about Sass and Compass,
    which provide us with a new syntax to better organize our project, and a bunch
    of useful functions that we'll see later in this book.

    how to use some libraries that do this task for us, either client or server side.

- en: Well, there's nothing more to say here, I hope that you'll find the projects
    at least as interesting and fun to develop as I did, and that from them you'll
    learn new techniques, properties, and tools to help in your day-to-day job.

- en: '[Chapter 1](ch01.html "Chapter 1. No Sign Up? No Party!"), *No Sign Up? No
    Party!*, will show you how to create a subscription form for your upcoming party.
    We use this chapter to discover how CSS3 features, such as some new pseudo-selectors,
    can enhance a form by adding specific styles to required fields or to valid/invalid
    ones.'

- en: '[Chapter 2](ch02.html "Chapter 2. Shiny Buttons"), *Shiny Buttons*, will show
    you how to create some CSS3 enhanced buttons by using techniques such as rounded
    corners, multiple backgrounds, gradients, and shadows. Then we animate them using
    the classic `:hover` pseudo-selector with CSS3 transitions.'

- en: '[Chapter 3](ch03.html "Chapter 3. Omni Menu"), *Omni Menu*, focuses on developing
    a menu that behaves differently according to the device we are using to view it.
    We achieve this goal using media queries and a nice feature detection library.'

- en: '[Chapter 4](ch04.html "Chapter 4. Zooming User Interface"), *Zooming User Interface*,
    uses CSS3 transitions mixed with SVG graphics and the new `:target` pseudo-selector
    to create a fully functional zooming user interface that displays a cool infographic.'

- en: '[Chapter 5](ch05.html "Chapter 5. An Image Gallery"), *An Image Gallery*, will
    show you how to develop a pure CSS3 image slideshow with different transition
    effects such as fading, sliding and 3D rotation, and multiple navigation modes.
    Switching between different effects is made possible using the new `:checked`
    pseudo-selector. This chapter also introduces Sass, an extension of CSS3 that
    we can use to write cleaner, more readable, and smaller CSS files.'

- en: '[Chapter 6](ch06.html "Chapter 6. Parallax Scrolling"), *Parallax Scrolling*,
    focuses on building a real parallax effect triggered on page scroll. This is archived
    using 3D transform properties, such as `transform-style` and `perspective`.'

- en: '[Chapter 7](ch07.html "Chapter 7. Video Killed the Radio Star"), *Video Killed
    the Radio Star*, experiments with some cool video effects that can be archived
    using CSS3, including static and animated masks, blur, black and white, and so
    on. This chapter also deals with some interesting backward- and cross-browser
    compatibility issues.'

- en: '[Chapter 8](ch08.html "Chapter 8. Go Go Gauges"), *Go Go Gauges*, shows how
    to take full advantage of the new CSS3 properties by creating an animated gauge
    that can be used as a widget in a webpage. This project also introduces the Compass:
    a Sass plugin that takes care of experimental prefixes, Reset stylesheet, and
    so on.'

    takes CSS3 animations to another level by creating a 3D animation that uses a
    camera moving in a 3D scene.'

    you how to create bar charts and pie charts with CSS3 without the need for anything
    other than CSS and HTML. With the right polyfills we can then make these charts
    behave well even on older browsers.'

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To develop the projects provided with this book you need a text editor (for
    example, Sublime Text 2, Notepad ++, and so on), and a web server to run the code.
    If you have never installed a web server, you may want to use a pre-packaged solution
    such as MAMP for Mac ([http://www.mamp.info/en/mamp/index.html](http://www.mamp.info/en/mamp/index.html))
    or WampServer for Windows ([http://www.wampserver.com/](http://www.wampserver.com/)).
    These packages also install PHP and MySQL, that are not required to run the projects
    of this book, so you can simply ignore them.
  prefs: []

- en: Once you have downloaded, installed, and started the web server, you can create
    the projects within the web server's document root.
