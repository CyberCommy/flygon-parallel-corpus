- en: Modern game animation is a bit of a black art. There are not many resources
    available that detail how to build a track-driven animation system, or advanced
    topics such as dual quaternion skinning. That is the void this book aims to fill.
    The goal of this book is to shed some light on the black art of animation programming
    and make the topic approachable for everyone.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book takes a "theory to implementation" approach, where you will learn
    the theory of each topic discussed first. Once you understand the theory, you
    will implement it to get hands-on experience.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book makes it a point to focus on the concepts and implementation details
    of animation programming, not the language or graphics API being used. By focusing
    on these fundamental concepts, you will be able to implement an animation system
    regardless of language or graphics API.

- en: This book is for programmers who want to learn how to build a modern animation
    system. The only requirement for following along with this book is some familiarity
    with C++. Other than that, everything is covered, from how to open a new window,
    to creating an OpenGL context, rendering an animated model, and advanced animation
    techniques.

    Game Window*, explains how to create a new visual studio project, create a Win32
    window, set up an OpenGL 3.3 render context, and enable vsynch. The code samples
    for this book are compiled against OpenGL 3.3\. All the OpenGL code is compatible
    with the latest version of OpenGL and OpenGL 4.6.'

    object. These transform objects can be arranged in a hierarchy.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[*Chapter 6*](B16191_06_Final_JC_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor104)*, Building an
    Abstract Renderer*, shows you how to create an abstraction layer on top of OpenGL
    3.3\. The rest of this book will use this abstraction for rendering. By using
    an abstraction, we can focus on the core concepts of animation programming instead
    of the API being used to implement it. The abstraction layer targets OpenGL 3.3,
    but the code is valid with OpenGL 4.6 as well.'

    the glTF File Format*, introduces the glTF file format. glTF is a standard open
    file format that is supported by most 3D content creation tools. Being able to
    load a common format will let you load animation authored in almost any creation
    tool.'

    donâ€™t have to be a hardened C++ master, but you should be able to debug simple
    C++ problems. Having some experience with OpenGL is a plus, but not required.
    No advanced C++ features are used. The provided code compiles against C++ 11 or
    the most recent version.

- en: The code in this book is written against OpenGL 3.3 Core. The OpenGL code presented
    in this book is forward compatible; the highest compatible version of OpenGL at
    the time of publishing is 4.6\. In [*Chapter 6*](B16191_06_Final_JC_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor104),
    Building an Abstract Renderer, you will implement a thin abstraction layer on
    top of OpenGL. Throughout the rest of the book, you will be coding against this
    abstraction layer, rather than OpenGL directly.
