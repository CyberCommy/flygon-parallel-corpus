- en: Realtime applications have dominated the field of web applications for years.
    Real time isn't limited to only displaying data as soon as it's available; it
    shows its real power when used with interactive experiences, in which users and
    systems can instantly communicate with one another. With features such as virtual
    DOM and declarative views, React proves to be a better fit for such Realtime applications.
    Firebase makes building and rapid-prototyping these kinds of applications simpler
    by letting you focus on how the application should behave and look, without getting
    bogged down in the more tedious parts of Realtime development.

- en: This book will cover the Firebase features such as Cloud Storage, Cloud Function,
    Hosting, and Realtime Database integration with React to develop rich, collaborative,
    real-time applications using only client-side code. We can also see how we can
    secure our application using Firebase Authentication and Database Security Rules.
    We also leverage the power of Redux to organize the data in the frontend. Redux
    attempts to make state mutations predictable by imposing certain restrictions
    on how and when updates can happen. Toward the end of the book, you will have
    improved your React skills by realizing the potential of Firebase to create real-time
    serverless web applications.

- en: The idea behind this book is to help developers create real-time serverless
    applications really faster with React and Firebase. We wrote this book for the
    developers who want to create **Minimum Viable Product** (**MVP**) using Firebase
    to validate a business idea. This book is designed to provide practical knowledge
    to developers who have basic to intermediate knowledge of HTML, CSS, React, and
    JavaScript and want to learn more about React, Redux, and Firebase integration.
    This book is also aimed at developers who don't want to waste their time searching
    hundreds of tutorials of React, Redux, and Firebase and have everything in one
    place with real-life examples to get productive quickly. This book is for anyone
    interested in learning only Firebase.

    to read this book profitably. It is assumed that you know already how **Node Package
    Manager** (**npm**) works to install any dependencies, and you have a basic idea
    about ES6 Syntax.
