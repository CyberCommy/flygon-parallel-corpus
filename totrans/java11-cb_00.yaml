- en: This cookbook offers a range of software development examples that are illustrated
    by simple and straightforward code, providing step-by-step resources and time-saving
    methods to help you solve data problems efficiently. Starting with the installation
    of Java, each recipe addresses a specific problem and is accompanied by a discussion
    that explains the solution and offers insight into how it works. We cover major
    concepts about the core programming language, as well as common tasks involved
    in building a wide variety of software. You will follow recipes to learn about
    new features of the latest Java 11 release to make your application modular, secure,
    and fast.

- en: In order to get the most out of this book, some knowledge of Java and the ability
    to run Java programs is required. Also, it helps to have your favorite editor
    or, even better, an IDE installed and configured for use in the recipes. Because
    the book is essentially a collection of recipes, with each recipe being based
    on specific examples, the benefits of the book will be lost if the reader does
    not execute the examples provided. Readers will get even more from this book if
    they reproduce every example that is provided in their IDE, execute it, and compare
    their result with the one shown in the book.
