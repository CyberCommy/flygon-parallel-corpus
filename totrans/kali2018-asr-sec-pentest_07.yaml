- en: Social engineering is the practice of learning and obtaining valuable information
    by exploiting human vulnerabilities. It is an art of deception that is considered
    to be vital for a penetration tester when there is a lack of information about
    the target that can be exploited. As people are the weakest link in the security
    defense of any organization, this is the most vulnerable layer in the security
    infrastructure. We are social creatures, and hence our nature makes us vulnerable
    to social engineering attacks. Social engineers employ these attacks to obtain
    confidential information or gain access to restricted areas. Social engineering
    takes different forms of attack vectors; each is limited by an individual's imagination,
    based on the influence and direction under which it is being executed. This chapter
    will discuss the core principles and practices adopted by professional social
    engineers to manipulate humans into divulging information or performing an act.

    manipulating people, in order to achieve a desired goal. In many organizations,
    this practice can be evaluated to ensure the security integrity of the employees
    and investigate the process and human weaknesses. Note that the practice of social
    engineering is all too common and is adopted by a range of individuals, including
    penetration testers, scam artists, identity thieves, business partners, job recruiters,
    salespeople, information brokers, telemarketers, government spies, disgruntled
    employees, and even children. The differentiating factor between these diverse
    individuals is the motivation by which social engineers execute their tactics
    against the target.

    These are used to form a perception of reality. This natural phenomenon categorizes
    the human senses into sight, hearing, taste, touch, smell, balance and acceleration,
    temperature, kinesthetic, pain, and direction. The utilization of these senses
    effectively develops and maintains the method in which we perceive the world.

- en: From a social engineering perspective, any information retrieved or extracted
    from the target via the dominant senses (visual or auditory), eye movements (eye
    contact, verbal discrepancies, blink rate, or eye cues), facial expressions (surprise,
    happiness, fear, sadness, anger, or disgust), and other abstract entities observed
    or felt, may add a greater probability of success. Often, it is necessary for
    a social engineer to directly communicate with the target in order to obtain confidential
    information or access restricted zones. This communication can be performed physically,
    or by using electronically-assisted technology.

    interview and interrogation. However, in practice, each tactic includes other
    factors, such as environment, knowledge of the target, and the ability to control
    the frame of communication. These combined factors (communication, environment,
    knowledge, and frame-control) construct the basic set of skills for an effective
    social engineer to conduct a social engineering attack. The entire social engineering
    activity relies on a relationship of trust. If you cannot build a strong trust
    relationship with your target, you will most likely fail in your endeavor.'

    and execution are the common steps taken by social engineers to successfully divulge
    and acquire target information or access:'

    alluring target for your penetration test. This can be done by harvesting corporate
    email addresses across the web using advanced search engine tools; collecting
    personal information about people working for the target organization through
    online social networks; identifying third-party software packages used by the
    target organization; and getting involved in corporate business events and parties,
    and attending conferences, which should provide enough intelligence to select
    the most accurate insider for social engineering purposes.'

    can move forward to establish a trusting relationship and show friendliness. This
    would ensure that an attempt to hijack any confidential corporate information
    would not harm or alert the target. Maintaining a high level of covertness and
    concealment during the whole process is important. Alternatively, we can also
    investigate to find out whether the target organization is using older versions
    of the software, which can be exploited by delivering malicious content via an
    email or the web, which can, in turn, infect the trusted party''s computer.'

    to acquire the target's bank information, phishing would be the perfect solution
    unless the target has no email account. Hence, the attacker first collects or
    harvests email addresses from the target, and then prepares a scam page that looks
    and functions exactly like the original bank web interface.
  prefs: []

    sends a formal email (for example, the account details), which appears to be from
    the original bank's website, asking the target to visit a link in order to provide
    the attacker with up-to-date bank information. By holding qualitative skills on
    web technologies and using an advanced set of tools (for example, SSLstrip), a
    social engineer can easily automate this task in an effective manner. With regards
    to human-assisted scamming, we could accomplish this by physically appearing and
    impersonating the target's banker identity.

    This type of social engineering engagement may involve a casual and long-term
    business relationship. By exploiting the trust between business entities, someone
    could easily map their target to acquire any necessary information. For example,
    Bob is a professional hacker and wants to know about the physical security policy
    of the ABC company at its office building. After careful examination, he decides
    to develop a website, drawing the keen interest of two of their employees by selling
    antique pieces at cheap rates.

    addresses through social networks, internet forums, and so on. Out of the two
    employees, Alice begins to purchase stuff regularly and becomes the main target
    for Bob. Bob is now in a position where he could offer a special antique piece
    in exchange for the information he needs. Taking advantage of human psychological
    factors, he writes an email to Alice, and asks her to get the ABC company's physical
    security policy details, for which she would be entitled to a unique antique piece.
    Without noticing the business liability, she reveals this information to Bob.
    This proves that creating a fake situation, while strengthening the relationship
    by trading values, can be advantageous for social engineering.

- en: An attack method where one manipulates the target's business responsibilities
    is known as an **influential authority attack**. This kind of social engineering
    attack is sometimes part of an impersonation method. Humans, by nature, act in
    an automated fashion to accept instructions from their authority or senior management,
    even if their instincts suggest that certain instructions should not be pursued.
    This makes us vulnerable to certain threats. For example, if someone wanted to
    target the XYZ company's network administrator to acquire their authentication
    details, they would have observed and noted the phone numbers of the administrator
    and the CEO of the company through a reciprocation method. Now, using a call-spoofing
    service (for example, [www.spoofcard.com](http://www.spoofcard.com)) to call the
    network administrator, they would notice that the call is coming from the CEO
    and should be prioritized. This method influences the target to reveal information
    to an impersonated authority; as such, the target has to comply with the company's
    senior management instructions.

    their personal gain. The famous **Nigerian 419 Scam** ([www.419eater.com](http://www.419eater.com))
    is a typical example of human avarice. Let's take an example where Bob wants to
    collect personal information from XYZ University students. We assume that he already
    has the email addresses of all the students. Afterward, he develops an email message
    that offers vouchers with drastic discounts on iPods to all XYZ university students,
    who might then reply with their personal information (name, address, phone, email,
    date of birth, passport number, and so on).

    believe they'd get the latest iPod for free, many of them might fall for this
    scam. In the corporate world, this attack method can be extended to maximize commercial
    gain and achieve business objectives.

    and ideas. The most vulnerable part of any social connection is sexuality. In
    many cases, men and women attract and appeal to each other. Owing to this intense
    feeling and false sense of trust, we may end up inadvertently revealing information.
    There are several online social portals where people can meet and chat. These
    include Facebook, MySpace, Twitter, and Orkut. For instance, Bob is hired by the
    XYZ company to get the financial and marketing strategy of the ABC company in
    order to achieve a sustainable competitive advantage. He looks through a number
    of employees and finds a girl called Alice who is responsible for all business
    operations. Pretending to be a normal business graduate, he tries to find his
    way into a relationship with her (for example, through Facebook). Bob intentionally
    creates situations where he could run into Alice, such as social gatherings, including
    anniversaries, dance clubs, and music festivals. Once he acquires a certain level
    of trust, he can arrange to meet Alice regularly. This practice allows him to
    extract useful insights of the financial and marketing perspectives of the ABC
    company. Remember, the more effective and trustful relationships you create, the
    more you can socially engineer your target. There are tools that will make this
    task easier for you, for instance, SET, which we will describe in the next section.

- en: In this chapter, we discussed the common use of social engineering in various
    aspects of life. Penetration testers may come across situations where they have
    to apply social engineering tactics to acquire sensitive information from their
    targets. It is human nature to be vulnerable to specific deception techniques.
    For the best view of social engineering skills, we presented the basic set of
    elements (communication, environment, knowledge, and frame-control), which construct
    a model of human psychology. These psychological principles, in turn, help the
    social engineer adapt and extract the attack process (intelligence-gathering,
    identifying vulnerable points, planning the attack, and execution) and methods
    (impersonation, reciprocation, influential authority, scarcity, and social relationship)
    according to the target under examination. Then, we explained the use of SET to
    power up and automate a social engineering attack on the internet.
