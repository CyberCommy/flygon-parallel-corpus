- en: In this book, we will learn about the concepts that are required to manage real
    Linux-based networks. The goal is to help the reader grow from a beginner or an
    intermediate-level Linux user, to someone who can manage and support real Linux-based
    networks. The book starts with a couple of introductory chapters, in which the
    reader will set up their environment and then refresh some basics that will serve
    as the foundation for the rest of the book. From there, more advanced topics will
    be covered with useful examples, which the reader will be able to follow along
    with gaining valuable hands on practice.

    typically perform on the job such as installing Linux, setting up DHCP, sharing
    files, IP addressing, monitoring resources, and so on. These examples are covered
    for not one but two popular distributions, Debian and CentOS. Since these two
    are very popular distributions in the enterprise, the reader will be well prepared
    to manage networks based on one distribution or the other (and also the countless
    other distributions based on them).

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book requires you to have one or more computers at your disposal that are
    capable of running either Debian or CentOS, preferably both. It really doesn't
    matter if you run them on a virtual machine or physical hardware, as the only
    requirement is that you should be able to install one or both of these distributions
    and access them via a terminal. Root level access is required for these installations.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: While you can certainly use any Linux installations you may already have, it's
    highly recommended to have separate, fresh installations to work with, as some
    of our topics can be disruptive if they are run on production networks. If you
    are in doubt, VirtualBox or older machines that you may have lying around will
    do just fine. Network access is required, but that goes without saying, given
    the subject matter of this book.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Some general Linux know-how is expected. By no means is the user required to
    be advanced, as the purpose of this book is to upgrade your existing knowledge.
    That being said, there are a few things that you should already be familiar with
    in order to have the smoothest possible experience. First, you should already
    know how to modify configuration files using a text editor. No assumptions are
    made in this book as to which text editor you use, it's really up to you. As long
    as you understand any text editor, whether it be nano, vim, or even gedit—you're
    in good shape. If you can open a root-owned configuration file, then make changes
    and save it—you're all set. If in doubt, nano is a great text editor for beginners
    and only takes a few minutes to learn. For the more advanced users, vim is a good
    choice. Speaking of root, you should also understand the difference between running
    commands as a root or a normal user. Also, you should be able to navigate the
    file system and browse around.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, even if you need to brush up on the editing of text files or switching
    to the root user, don't let that stop you. There is quite a bit of knowledge online
    that you can use to brush up, most text editors available for Linux offer really
    good documentation.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book is targeted at the users who already know the basics of Linux, who
    want to learn how to manage Linux-based networks or take their skills to the next
    level. This can either be for the purpose of supporting an all-Linux network or
    even a mixed environment. This book takes the reader through easier topics such
    as installing Debian, to the more advanced concepts such as subnetting. By the
    end of this book, you should have enough knowledge to set up a completely networked
    environment, including all the components that such a network should feature.
    If this excites you, then this book is definitely for you!

- en: However, in this book we focus on real-world examples pertaining only to Linux.
    If your goal is to become certified with Cisco or obtain some other high-level
    certification, this may not be the best place for you. Here, it's all about practical
    examples, without focusing too much on the theory. While certification cram books
    are neat, in this book we get things done – the real things that you will be required
    to do if asked by your boss or client to implement a Linux network. If that's
    your goal, you're definitely in the right place.
