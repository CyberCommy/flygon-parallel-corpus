    screen that appears, we select the option **Boot into the Helix Live CD** to directly
    boot Helix. You can, however, use the option **Install Helix** if you wish to
    install Helix on the system.![How to do it?](img/B04234_08_42.jpg)

    of the hard disks/storage so that it can be investigated later. To create a bit-by-bit
    copy of the hard disk, we will use a tool named **Adepto** available in Helix.

    we get the tool.![How to do it?](img/B04234_08_43.jpg)

    the device from the drop-down menu and we get all the information about that device.
    In our case, we have selected the USB device we want to copy.![How to do it?](img/B04234_08_44.jpg)

    so, we click on **Restore/Clone** tab. Enter the source and destination and press
    **Clone** to start:![How to do it?](img/B04234_08_48.jpg)

    time and this may also depend on the size of the disk being copied as well as
    the system's processing capabilities:![How to do it?](img/B04234_08_49.jpg)

    see that we have an exact image of the device we have cloned in our second USB
    device.![How to do it?](img/B04234_08_50.jpg)
