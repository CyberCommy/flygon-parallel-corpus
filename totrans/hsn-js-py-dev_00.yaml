- en: In learning Python, you took the first step in your software engineering career
    by learning Python's fundamentals, its elegance, and its programming principles.
    For the next stage of your career, let's learn how to transfer your programming
    knowledge to JavaScript to work on frontend tasks, including UX/UI work, form
    validation, frontend animations, and more. You may be familiar with rendering
    the frontend with Flask, but JavaScript will allow you to create user interfaces
    and react in real time to user input.

    syntactical level, but also semantical: *why* and *when* we use JavaScript over
    Python, what their separations of concerns are, how we connect our existing HTML
    and CSS with JavaScript on the frontends and backends using Node.js to create
    engaging user experiences, and how we create full-stack applications utilizing
    all layers of a web application.'

- en: One size does *not* fit all in software engineering. Python is an approachable,
    scalable language designed for backend web work but can open the door to curiosity
    about the frontend. This book is written for programmers with 1-3 years of Python
    experience who wish to expand their knowledge of the web ecosystem to the frontend
    programming world enabled by JavaScript and understand how using JavaScript on
    both the frontend and the backend, through Node.js, leads to efficient coding
    and workflows.

    to grasping the concepts laid out in this book. Familiarity with HTML, CSS, the
    **Document Object Model** (**DOM**), and Flask and/or Django will come in handy.

    editor installed on your computer, such as Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, or
    another general-purpose programming environment. A mobile device such as a tablet
    will likely not be an appropriate environment due to the coding environment limitations,
    though a lower-end machine will work. We will be working with command-line tools,
    so familiarity with the macOS Terminal will be useful; Windows OS users should
    download and install Git Bash or a similar terminal program as the standard Windows
    Command Prompt will not be sufficient.
