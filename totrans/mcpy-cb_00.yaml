- en: MicroPython is a lean implementation of the Python 3 programming language that
    is capable of running on a wide range of microcontrollers. It provides the majority
    of features in the Python programming language, such as functions, classes, lists,
    dictionaries, strings, reading and writing files, list comprehensions, and exception
    handling to these microcontrollers.

- en: Microcontrollers are tiny computers that usually include a CPU, memory, and
    input/output peripherals. Even though they will have more limited resources compared
    to a PC, they can be made to a much smaller dimension, with less power consumption
    and at a lower cost. These strengths make it possible to use them in a wide range
    of new applications that weren’t possible before.

- en: This book will cover a number of different features in the MicroPython language,
    as well as a number of different microcontroller boards. The initial chapters
    will provide simple and easy to understand recipes to get these boards to interact
    with people and their environment. Topics ranging from reading temperature, light,
    and motion data from sensors to interacting with push buttons, slide switches,
    and touchpads will also be covered. Producing output on these boards with audio
    playback and LED animations will also be covered in the early chapters. Once this
    foundation is in place, we will build more involved projects, such as interactive
    two-player games, electronic musical instruments, and an **Internet of Things**
    (**IoT**) weather machine. You will be able to take the skills you learn from
    these recipes and directly apply them to your own embedded projects.
