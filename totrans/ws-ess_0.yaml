- en: HTML, the most important part of web development, was lacking somewhere, but
    now developers are returning to HTML5 because of its enhancements and features,
    giving them a new experience of development. WebSocket support on different browsers
    made it easier to develop web applications with a lot of features.

- en: Data communication between the client and the server is one of the most important
    parts of any web application. Almost all browsers support WebSockets, which makes
    it more powerful and available. Developers always want to build their application
    on a concrete ground so that it is reliable for users. WebSocket makes this possible
    now. With HTML5 enhancements, it is being accepted and appreciated widely in the
    community.

- en: In this book, you will learn and understand how WebSockets with HTML5 can create
    great applications, especially applications where data needs to be pushed from
    both the client side and the server side. With some basic sample applications
    that we will create in this book, you will understand how the client can be set
    up and how the Node.js-based WebSocket server can be created with ease.
