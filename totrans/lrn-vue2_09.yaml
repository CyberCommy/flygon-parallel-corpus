    Vue.js work, and we touched different aspects of Vue.js such as *components*,
    *directives*, *plugins*, and application *state*. We learned different ways of
    installing Vue.js, starting from using a simple standalone compiled script, passing
    by using the CDN version, NPM version, and going toward using the development
    version of Vue.js being able to not only use it but also contribute to its codebase .

    interfaces. Now, we have the emerging **Weex**, a framework that renders Vue-inspired
    components into native apps ( [https://github.com/alibaba/weex](https://github.com/alibaba/weex)

    that we have to provide a way of every person having their own shopping list application,
    which is only possible with an authentication mechanism.

    list using the input field in the footer if we can change it, let's say, inline?
    Well, actually, shopping list's name editing in the input field was the first
    thing we implemented when we were learning how to achieve data binding in Vue
    applications. So, it made sense at the time, but now it can and should be improved.

    checked items on the list.

    highlighting, shopping list items can do some tiny bouncing when they are checked,
    the process of changing the title of the shopping list could also be highlighted
    in some way, and so on. The Pomodoro application can change its background color
    on each of the state's transitions. It can also be aware of the time of the day
    and color the background accordingly. The number of opportunities is endless.
