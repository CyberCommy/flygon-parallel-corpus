    practical book that follows a cookbook''s style. Each recipe focuses on a single
    task and contains command line examples, sample output, a detailed explanation,
    and additional tips that could come in handy.'

- en: Nmap's vast functionality is explored through nine chapters covering 100 different
    tasks for penetration testers and system administrators. Unlike Nmap's official
    book, this cookbook focuses on tasks that you can do with the Nmap Scripting Engine,
    without forgetting to cover the core functionality of Nmap.

- en: There were many great NSE scripts I wish I had more space to include in this
    book and many more that will be created after its publication. Luis Martin Garcia
    recently posted an interesting video that shows how much Nmap has grown over the
    years at [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rlF1MSAbXk](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rlF1MSAbXk).
    I invite you to register for the development mailing list and stay up-to-date
    with Nmap's latest features and NSE scripts.

    such as brute force password audits on remote networks and devices. These tasks
    are likely to be illegal in your jurisdiction in many circumstances, or at least
    count as a terms of service violation or professional misconduct. The instructions
    are provided so that you can test your system against threats, understand the
    nature of those threats, and protect your own systems from similar attacks. Before
    following them make sure you are on the correct side of the legal and ethical
    line... use your powers for good!
