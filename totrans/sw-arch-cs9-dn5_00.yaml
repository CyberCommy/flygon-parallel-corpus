- en: This book covers the most common design patterns and frameworks involved in
    modern cloud-based and distributed software architectures. It discusses when and
    how to use each pattern, by providing you with practical real-world scenarios.
    This book also presents techniques and processes such as DevOps, microservices,
    Kubernetes, continuous integration, and cloud computing, so that you can have
    a best-in-class software solution developed and delivered for your customers.

    you. It will guide you to deliver and solve the biggest problems you can face
    during development. It also covers the do's and don'ts that you need to follow
    when you manage your application in a cloud-based environment. You will learn
    about different architectural approaches, such as layered architectures, service-oriented
    architecture, microservices, Single Page Applications, and cloud architecture,
    and understand how to apply them to specific business requirements.

    All the concepts in this book will be explained with the help of real-world practical
    use cases where design principles make the difference when creating safe and robust
    applications. By the end of the book, you will be able to develop and deliver
    highly scalable and secure enterprise-ready applications that meet the end customers'
    business needs.

    to the new opportunities offered by C# 9 and .Net 5\. We added all new frameworks
    and technologies that emerged in the last year such as gRPC, and Blazor, and described
    Kubernetes in more detail in a dedicated chapter.
