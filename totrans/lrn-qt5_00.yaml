- en: Qt is a mature and powerful framework for delivering sophisticated applications
    across a multitude of platforms. It is widely used in embedded devices, including
    TVs, satellite set-top boxes, medical equipment, car dashboards, and much more.
    It also has a rich history in the Linux world, with KDE and Sailfish OS using
    it extensively and many apps in the stores being developed using Qt. It has also
    made great strides in the mobile arena over the past few years. However, in the
    Microsoft Windows and Apple macOS X worlds, the dominance of C#/.NET and Objective-C/Cocoa
    means that Qt is often overlooked.

- en: This book aims to demonstrate the power and flexibility of the Qt framework
    and show how you can write your application once and deploy it to multiple operating
    system desktops. The reader will build a complete real-world **Line of Business**
    (**LOB**) solution from scratch, with distinct library, user interface, and unit
    test projects.

- en: We will cover building a modern and responsive user interface with QML and wiring
    it up to rich C++ classes. We will control every aspect of our project configuration
    and output with QMake, including platform detection and conditional expressions.
    We will build “self-aware” data entities that can serialize themselves to and
    from JSON. We will persist those data entities in a database and learn how to
    find and update them. We will reach out to the internet and consume an RSS feed.
    Finally, we will produce an installation package so that we can deploy our application
    onto other machines.

    most LOB applications and will empower the reader to progress from blank page

- en: This book targets application developers looking for a powerful and flexible
    framework for creating modern and responsive applications on Microsoft Windows,
    Apple Mac OS X, and Linux desktop platforms. Although focused on desktop application
    development, the techniques discussed are largely applicable to mobile development
    also.

- en: The reader should be comfortable with C++, but no prior knowledge of Qt or QML
    is required. On Mac OS X, you will need to install XCode and have launched it
    at least once. On Windows, you may optionally install Visual Studio in order to
    have the MSVC compiler available.
