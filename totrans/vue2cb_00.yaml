- en: Vue.js 2 is a minimal but powerful framework. It will empower you to quickly
    prototype small applications, and it won't get in the way when structuring large
    frontend systems. This is a cookbook and every paragraph is a recipe; just as
    with a regular cookbook, you can quickly skip to the recipe that interests you
    or read it cover to cover to become a great chef.

- en: All the recipes (except a handful) represent working Vue apps, so at the end
    of the exercise you are never left empty handed. When I wrote them, I tried to
    give meaningful examples and sprinkle some fun where possible. All the recipes
    are slightly different when it comes to doing the same thing, so that you will
    learn something new even when implementing very similar recipes.

- en: This book took about 6 months to write, and even in this short amount of time
    I had to go back and update pictures and the API that changed, as well as add
    new concepts. Still, many recipes are imbued with the everlasting concepts of
    reusability and good engineering, so I like to think that some parts of this will
    remain with you, the reader, as useful techniques to reuse in your apps.

    to illustrate the desired output, I think it is paramount for you to actually
    type and try out the recipes while learning.

- en: To follow along with this book, you'll need a computer with an Internet connection.
    You can choose to work online on Chrome to complete the recipes. At some point,
    you will need at least a text editor; I highly recommend Microsoft Visual Studio
    Code for this job.

- en: This book has been tested on people who didn’t even know JavaScript. They were
    able to pick up Vue by reading the first chapter! Going forward, you will find
    concepts that are more and more advanced and, even if you are familiar with Vue
    2, you will probably find some trick you didn't know about or some wise suggestion
    that will help you along the way.

    Vue developer. On the other hand, if you already are, it provides a good reference
    for many different features and techniques that may come in handy from time to
    time. Finally, this book is also a valid migration guide if you have already experimented
    with Vue 1 and you feel overwhelmed by change.
