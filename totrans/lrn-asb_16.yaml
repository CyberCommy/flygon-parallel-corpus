    website and command-line tool. I am sure that you will agree that Ansible Galaxy
    offers valuable community services in that it allows Ansible users to share roles
    for common tasks as well as a way for users to make contributions to the Ansible
    community by publishing their own roles.

    bug trackers before using roles from Ansible Galaxy in production environments;
    after all, a lot of these roles need to have escalated privileges in order to
    be able to successfully execute their tasks.
