    enough to compile everything from JSX syntax to static images into bundles that
    are ready to deploy. It also comes with a development server. Its main drawback
    is its complexity. There are a lot of moving parts that need to be configured
    just to get Webpack off the ground, but you didn't have to touch any of it. This
    is because most of the Webpack configuration values that you would set for a React
    app are the same for most React apps.
  id: totrans-20

- en: The job of Webpack is to bundle your application resources so that they can
    be easily served from the web. This means that you have to configure various things
    related to bundle output, starting with the output path and file. The Webpack
    development server doesn't actually write a bundle file to disk because it is
    assumed that builds will happen frequently. The resulting bundle is kept in memory.
    Even with this in mind, you still have to configure the main output path because
    the Webpack development server still needs to serve it to the browser as though
    it were a real file.
  id: totrans-30
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In addition to the main output location, you can also configure chunk filenames
    and the public path used to serve files from. Chunks are bundles that are split
    into smaller pieces to avoid creating a single bundle file that's too big and
    might cause performance problems. Wait, what? Thinking about performance and the
    path used to serve resources before you've even implemented a single component
    for your application? This is completely unnecessary at this point in the project.
    Don't worry, `react-scripts` has you covered and provides configuration for output
    that you probably won't ever need to change.

- en: One of the key strengths of Webpack is that you don't need to supply it with
    a list of modules that need to be bundled. Once you supply an entry point in the
    Webpack configuration, it can figure out which modules your application needs,
    and will bundle them accordingly. Needless to say, this is a complex task that
    Webpack is performing for you and needs all the help it can get.
  id: totrans-33
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: Webpack的一个关键优势是你不需要提供一个需要捆绑的模块列表。一旦在Webpack配置中提供了一个入口点，它就可以找出你的应用程序需要哪些模块，并相应地捆绑它们。不用说，这是Webpack为你执行的一个复杂的任务，它需要尽可能多的帮助。
- en: For example, part of the `resolve` configuration is telling Webpack which file
    extensions to consider, for example, `.js` or `.jsx`. You also want to tell Webpack
    where to look for package modules. These are modules that you didn't write and
    aren't part of your application. These are npm packages that are typically found
    in the `node_modules` directory of your project.
  id: totrans-34
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 例如，`resolve`配置的一部分是告诉Webpack要考虑哪些文件扩展名，例如`.js`或`.jsx`。你还想告诉Webpack在哪里查找包模块。这些是你没有编写的模块，也不是你应用程序的一部分。这些通常可以在项目的`node_modules`目录中找到的npm包。
- en: There are more advanced options as well, such as creating aliases for modules
    and using resolver plugins. Once again, none of these things are relevant to you
    before you write any React code, yet, you need them configured so that you can
    develop your components, unless of course, you're using `react-scripts` to take
    care of this configuration for you.
  id: totrans-35

  zh: 好消息是，弹出过程的一部分涉及为项目设置脚本和配置值。基本上，这与`react-scripts`在内部使用的是相同的东西，只是现在这些脚本和配置文件被复制到你的项目目录中供你维护。例如，弹出后，你会看到一个包含以下文件的`scripts`目录：

    you invoke using `npm` now reference your local scripts instead of referencing

    `config` directory that was created for you when you ran eject. Here are the relevant
    Webpack configuration files found here:'

  zh: 现在，如果您查看`package.json`，您会发现您使用`npm`调用的脚本现在引用您的本地脚本，而不是引用`react-scripts`包。反过来，这些脚本使用在您运行弹出时为您创建的`config`目录中找到的文件。以下是在此处找到的相关Webpack配置文件：

    set up the exact same way and will remain so until you change it.

    able to receive updates when your source changed, but as discussed earlier in
    the chapter, these updates will wipe out any state in the component before the

    keep any state in your components. Let's try it out.

    the need to eject from `create-react-app` so that you can tweak the configuration.
    I would caution against changing what's absolutely necessary. Make sure that you
    have a specific goal in mind when you change the configuration that `create-react-app`
    gives you. In other words, don't undo all the work that `create-react-app` has
    done for you.

    created with `create-react-app`. You then learned that the `react-scripts` package
    has its own Webpack configuration that it uses when it starts the development
    server for you. We went over the key areas of configuration that you shouldn't
    necessarily have to think about when you're trying to write an application.

- en: Finally, you saw hot module reloading in action. Out of the box, `react-scripts`
    reloads the app for you when you make source changes. This results in a page refresh,
    which is good enough to get started. We then looked at the potential challenges
    of developing components using this approach because it wipes out any state that
    the component had before it was updated. So you ejected from `create-react-app`
    and customized the Webpack configuration for your project to support hot component
    reloading that will preserve the state.
  id: totrans-127

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 最后，您看到了热模块重新加载的实际操作。`react-scripts`默认情况下在您进行源代码更改时重新加载应用程序。这会导致页面刷新，这已经足够好用了。然后我们看了一下使用这种方法开发组件可能面临的挑战，因为它会清除组件在更新之前的任何状态。因此，您从`create-react-app`中退出，并自定义了项目的Webpack配置，以支持保留状态的热组件重新加载。
