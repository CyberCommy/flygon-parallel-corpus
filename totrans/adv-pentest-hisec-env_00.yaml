- en: Penetration testers are faced with a combination of firewalls, intrusion detection
    systems, host-based protection, hardened systems, and teams of knowledgeable analysts
    that pour over data collected by their security information management systems.
    In an environment such as this, simply running automated tools will typically
    yield few results. The false sense of this security can easily result in the loss
    of critical data and resources.

- en: '*Advanced Penetration Testing for Highly Secured Environments* provides guidance
    on going beyond the basic automated scan. It will provide you with a stepping
    stone which can be used to take on the complex and daunting task of effectively
    measuring the entire attack surface of a traditionally secured environment.'

- en: '*Advanced Penetration Testing for Highly Secured Environments* uses only freely
    available tools and resources to teach these concepts. One of the tools we will
    be using is the well-known penetration testing platform BackTrack. BackTrack''s
    amazing team of developers continuously update the platform to provide some of
    the best security tools available. Most of the tools we will use for simulating
    a penetration test are contained on the most recent version of BackTrack.'

    the standard will be addressed, we will attempt to align the knowledge in this
    book with the basic principles of the standard when possible.

    instructions on how to emulate a highly secured environment on your own equipment
    using VirtualBox, pfSense, snort, and similar technologies. This enables you to
    practice what you have learned throughout the book in a safe environment. You
    will also get a chance to witness what security response teams may see on their
    side of the penetration test while you are performing your testing!'

- en: '*Advanced Penetration Testing for Highly Secured Environments* wraps up by
    presenting a challenge in which you will use your virtual lab to simulate an entire
    penetration test from beginning to end. Penetration testers need to be able to
    explain mitigation tactics with their clients; with this in mind we will be addressing
    various mitigation strategies that will address the attacks listed throughout
    the chapters.'

- en: '[Chapter 1](ch01.html "Chapter 1. Planning and Scoping for a Successful Penetration
    Test"), *Planning and Scoping for a Successful Penetration Test*, introduces you
    to the anatomy of a penetration test. You will learn how to effectively determine
    the scope of the penetration test as well as where to place your limits, such
    as when dealing with third-party vendor equipment or environments. Prioritization
    techniques will also be discussed.'

- en: '[Chapter 2](ch02.html "Chapter 2. Advanced Reconnaissance Techniques"), *Advanced
    Reconnaissance Techniques*, will guide you through methods of data collection
    that will typically avoid setting off alerts. We will focus on various reconnaissance
    strategies including digging into the deep web and specialty sites to find information
    about your target.'

- en: '[Chapter 3](ch03.html "Chapter 3. Enumeration: Choosing Your Targets Wisely"),
    *Enumeration: Choosing Your Targets Wisely*, provides a thorough description of
    the methods used to perform system footprinting and network enumeration. The goal
    is to enumerate the environment and to explain what to look for when selecting
    your targets. This chapter touches upon mid to advanced Nmap techniques and using
    PBNJ to detect changes on the network. The chapter closes with tips on how to
    avoid enumeration attempts as well as methods of trying to confuse an attacker
    (to buy time for the blue team).'

    will delve into the Metasploit® framework. We will also describe team based testing
    with Armitage. We take a look at proof of concept exploit code from `Exploit-DB.com`
    which we will rewrite and compile; we also take a look at THC Hydra and John the
    Ripper for password attacks.'

    Exploitation*, has a focus on web application attacks. We will begin by providing
    step-by-step instructions on how to build a web application exploitation lab and
    then move toward detailing the usage of w3af and WebScarab. Load balancing is
    discussed in detail as many environments now have these features. We introduce
    you to methods of detecting web application firewalls and load balancing with
    hands-on examples. We finish this chapter with an introduction to the Mantra browser.'
