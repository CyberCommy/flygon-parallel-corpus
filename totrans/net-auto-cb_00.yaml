- en: '*Network Automation Cookbook* provides an overview of the various topics of
    network automation and how to use software development practices in order to design
    and operate different networking solutions. We use Ansible as our framework to
    introduce the topic of network automation and how to manage different vendor equipment
    using Ansible. In the first section, we outline how to install and configure Ansible
    specifically for the purpose of network automation. We will explore how we can
    use Ansible to manage traditional network solutions from various vendors such
    as Cisco, Juniper, Arista, and F5\. Next, we continue to explore how to utilize
    Ansible to build and scale network solutions from major cloud providers such as
    AWS, Azure, and **Google Cloud Platform** (**GCP**). Finally, we outline different
    supporting open source projects in network automation, such as NetBox, Batfish,
    and AWX. We outline how to integrate all these tools with Ansible in order to
    build a complete framework for network automation.'

    Ansible with different vendor equipment and how to build a network automation
    solution based on Ansible. Further, you will understand how to use various open
    source projects and how to integrate all these solutions with Ansible to build
    a robust and scalable network automation framework.
