    are designed and developed using the mobile-first approach. Angular is every developer''s
    dream framework that is used for rapid prototyping in order to deploy complex
    enterprise applications. This book will guide you in jump-starting Angular application
    development using the Bootstrap CSS framework. Each chapter in this book is structured
    to give you a full understanding of a specific topic and aspect of the Angular
    framework, along with other related libraries and frameworks. Each of these aspects
    are essential for designing and developing a robust Angular application. In a
    step-by-step approach, you will learn about each of the following phases: TypeScript,
    Bootstrap framework, Angular routing, components, templates, Angular Material,
    dependency injection, and much more.'
