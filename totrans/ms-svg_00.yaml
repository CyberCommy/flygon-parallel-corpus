- en: This book is for web developers and designers looking to add scalable, device-independent
    animation, images, and visualizations to their projects. Scalable Vector Graphics
    is an image file format introduced in 1998 by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).
    For many years, it languished behind poor browser compatibility and an unfriendly
    API. Over the past few years, it has become a vital part of the modern web development
    toolkit. SVG offers many important features for the modern web. For example, in
    a world of multiple device resolutions, it offers a simple path to high-quality
    image scaling without having to produce multiple resolutions for your image and
    without having to jump through complicated markup patterns. Also, being built
    in XML-based markup, it also allows easy access to common JavaScript patterns
    for creating highly interactive interfaces.
