    and macros, giving you a comprehensive foundation of the implementation details
    of the kernelâ€™s core services and mechanisms. You will also look at the Linux
    kernel as well-designed software, which gives us insights into software design
    in general that are easily scalable yet fundamentally strong and safe.

    Processes, Address Space, and Threads](part0020.html#J2B80-7300e3ede2f245b0b80e1b18d02a323f),
    looks closely at one of the principal abstractions of Linux called the process
    and the whole ecosystem, which facilitate this abstraction. We will also spend
    time in understanding address space, process creation, and threads.'

    the Process Scheduler*, explains process scheduling, which is a vital aspect of
    any operating system. Here we will build our understanding of the different scheduling
    policies engaged by Linux to deliver effective process execution.'

    Management and Allocators*, traverses us through one of the most crucial aspects
    of the Linux kernel, comprehending various nuances of memory representations and
    allocations. We will also gauge the efficiency of the kernel in maximizing resource
    usage at minimal costs.'

    typical filesystem, its fabric, design, and what makes it an elemental part of
    an operating system. We will also look at abstraction, using the common, layered
    architecture design, which the kernel comprehensively imbibes through the VFS.

    We will explore the layout and relationship between various data structures for
    each IPC mechanism, and look at both the SysV and POSIX IPC mechanisms.'

    management and page tables. We will look into the various aspects of the virtual
    memory subsystem such as process virtual address space and its segments, memory
    descriptor structure, memory mapping and VMA objects, page cache and address translation
    with page tables.'
