    and using the GUID as part of the name. These file names will be different on
    different computers, and will also be different every time you do a clean recompile
    of the application on your computer. There is also a master HTML file generated
    (`com.packtpub.gwtbook.hellogwt.HelloGWT. nocache.html`) that selects the right
    HTML file from the above files and loads it, depending on the browser that is
    running the application.

    package. This server code needs to be compiled and deployed in a servlet container
    so that the client application can communicate with the random quote service.
    We will learn about deploying to external servlet containers in[Chapter 10](ch10.html
    "Chapter 10. Deployment"). In normal development mode, we will use the hosted
    mode for testing, which runs the server code inside the embedded Tomcat servlet
    container in the GWT development shell. This makes it very easy to run and debug
    the server code from inside the same Eclipse environment as the client application
    code. This is another feature of GWT, which makes it an extremely productive environment
    for developing AJAX applications.

    shell window. This will compile the application and launch the application in

    for the application from the web browser, you will always see the HTML from the
    host page. This can be disconcerting when you are trying to debug problems. But
    the fantastic Eclipse support in GWT means that you can debug issues from the
    comfort of a graphical debugger by setting breakpoints and stepping through the
    entire application one line at a time! We will learn more about debugging of GWT
    applications in[Chapter 8](ch08.html "Chapter 8. Unit Tests").

    scripts like `applicationCreator`. We then generated the Eclipse support files
    for the project. We also created a new random quote AJAX application. We saw how
    to run this new application in both the hosted and web modes.
