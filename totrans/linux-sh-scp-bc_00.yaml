    of script creation. You will learn how to validate parameters and also how to
    check for the existence of files. Moving on, you will get well-versed with how
    variables work on a Linux system and how they relate to scripts. You'll also learn
    how to create and call subroutines and create interactive scripts. Finally, you
    will learn how to debug scripts and scripting best practices, which will enable
    you to write a great code every time! By the end of the book you will be able
    to write shell scripts that can dig data from the Web and process it efficiently.
