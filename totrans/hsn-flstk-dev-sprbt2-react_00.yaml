- en: In this book, we will create a modern web application using Spring Boot 2.0
    and React. We will start from the backend and develop a RESTful web service using
    Spring Boot and MariaDB. We will also secure the backend and create unit tests
    for it. The frontend will be developed using the React JavaScript library. Different
    third-party React components will be used to make the frontend more user friendly.
    Finally, the application will be deployed to Heroku. The book also demonstrates
    how to Dockerize our backend.
