    of distributions. No matter which company you work for these days, there's a good
    chance at least part of their infrastructure runs some flavor of Linux.

    and engineering (along with the tangentially related disciplines), though I would
    say that, of course... being a Linux sysadmin.

    Linux world, from the mundane and basic to the fun and complex, though anything
    can be complex if you try hard enough. I hope that, while reading it, you find
    something new (preferably a lot of new things) and maybe come across suggestions
    that you wouldn't have come across otherwise.
