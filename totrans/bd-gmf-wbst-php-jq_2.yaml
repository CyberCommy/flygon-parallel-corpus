    about where we are trying to go. This is where business objectives come into the

    emotion without losing sight of the business objectives, gamification is a serious
    business.

    to improve the process itself, wherever possible, whereas technology only facilitates
    the process. Therefore, gamification efforts will be scrutinized under a similar
    microscope and the success metrics that information technology efforts will. The
    fact that customers, employees, or stakeholders are having more fun with the organization's
    offering is not enough. It will need to meet a business objective.

    in mind that although we have defined the actions that we want our players to
    take, the strategies to motivate them to take that action vary from player to
    player. Gamification is definitely not a one-size-fits-all process. We will need
    to look at each of our target behaviors from the perspective of our players. We
    must take their motivations into consideration, unless our mechanics are pretty
    much trial and error. We will need an approach that's a little more structured.

    acts on the system and the system responds. We refer to how the user interacts
    with the system as activity loops. We will talk about two types of activity loops,
    **engagement loops** and **progression loops**, to describe our player interactions.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Engagement loops describe how a player engages with the system. They outline
    what a player does and how the system responds. Activity will be different for
    players depending on their motivations, so we must also take into consideration
    why the player is taking the action he is taking.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A progression loop describes how the player engages with the system as a whole.
    It outlines how he/she might progress through the game itself. Whereas engagement
    loops discuss what the player does on a detailed level, progression loops outline
    the movement of the player through the system.
  prefs: []

    the action and they get a feedback from the system, the feedback hopefully motivates
    the players enough to take another action. They take that action and get more

    would never stop playing our gamified system. Our goal is to get as close to this
