- en: Up until now, we have worked with a relatively simple form that only asks the
    user for some basic data but everything is hardcoded as a static form. If our
    mock website wanted to add or remove some fields from the form, we would have
    to manually make the changes, deploy them to our server, and possibly even adjust
    the backend to handle the different fields. But what if we wanted to automate
    this whole process?

- en: In this chapter, we will build an example dynamic form that will be completely
    powered by an API endpoint. Schema-driven forms are very powerful, as they can
    be controlled and modified directly by your application's API. That means when
    something changes in your backend, your form will automatically adjust itself
    not only on the frontend but also into a self-aware understanding of how to send
    the dynamic data back to the API.

    a Vue CLI 3 project. The first thing to do is to take a look at what we are going
    to be working with! The repository contains a very simple form with some input
    fields and a select box. You can find the structure for the form in `App.vue`.
    As you can see, we are using two different custom components, `BaseInput` and
    `BaseSelect`. Both of these can be found inside the `src/components` folder. They
    both wrap an `input` and `select` tag, respectively, and expose some properties
    that we can use to inject the necessary data into each of them, such as `labels`
    and `options`.

    is required to start making it a dynamic form is to remove the need to add `BaseInput`
    or `BaseSelect` directly to our `App.vue` file every time we need to add a new
    field. This implies that we are going to need to have some sort of organized structure,
    or schema, to represent what we are trying to accomplish for our form. Since we
    are using JavaScript, the most logical way to do this is with a JSON object format.
    This will make it easier later on when we want to take it a step further and have
    our mock API feed the information directly to our form.

    and inside of it, make a new `schema.json` file. We are going to populate our
    JSON file with some dummy data. I have chosen, for the sake of an example, to
    make the top element an object, and each property inside of it will represent
    one of the fields in our form. Each element will consist of at least a `component`
    property and a `label` property. In the case of drop-down menus, however, we will
    also include `options` to populate it.

    work at all without it. We have two computed properties. The first component takes
    care of dynamically loading whichever element we need. First, we create a `componentName`
    constant and assign it to the value of `element.component`, which is where the
    string name of our component is stored in the schema.

    purposes. The way that computed properties work regarding caching *requires* that

    inspected for dependencies.

    property that requires the correct component would be needed. For further information

    with its properties as `props` to whatever component we are loading using the
    `v-on` binding. For example, on the `BaseSelect` component, it will pass down
    the `options` property in our schema to the component so that it can render the
    correct options. If you are wondering why we are using a computed property instead
    of just passing the element directly to the `v-on` directive, you are on the right
    track. Right now, it is definitely not needed, but having it set up in this way
    to begin with allows us to, later on, add another level of logic or parsing that
    could be needed for a particular component.

    will not match completely the necessities of the frontend. Perhaps the API was
    built first, or was made with an earlier version of the frontend in mind that
    worked in a wildly different way; there are many possibilities, and in this case,
    we will adjust to an incompatible API to learn how to guard against this.

    the Axios `GET` method. Make sure you check that Mockoon is using the port `3000`
    for your mock API, or feel free to adjust the URL as needed. Axios calls return
    a promise—if it fails, we are going to log the error. If the call is successful
    however, we want to make sure that we capture the whole response and pass down
    the `data` property of this response to the schema's internal data. It's important
    to keep in mind that, in this particular case, the response the API is giving
    us should be the direct JSON schema object. If your API returns a different structure,
    such as a nested object or array, you will have to adjust accordingly.

    to break the application completely, as was expected. When we assigned the new
    APIs response to our schema's `data` property, the application tried to load each
    of the items into the renderer, but it is not prepared to understand this new
    format of schema that our backend is serving us.

    This is not a strict naming convention, so feel free to name it whatever makes
    more sense to you or your team. Inside this folder, we are going to make a new
    file called `Api.js`. Our goal for this file is to put all of the code that handles
    the parsing of the API schema into the app's schema here. This way, we can import
    whatever we need into our components, and we have a single source of truth regarding
    the translation of API to schema—if either of these ends change for any reason,
    we only have to update it here.

    Thankfully for us, it only implies a few lines of code.

    care whether it is there and set to null or undefined.

    to the end of this chapter but to the end of this book! In this chapter, you have
    acquired the knowledge and skills to understand the use cases of schema-driven
    forms, and the ability to create a `Renderer` component to accommodate these cases.
    You know how to create a library to parse the output from the backend into your
    own form and how to feed back the form data to the API when needed.
