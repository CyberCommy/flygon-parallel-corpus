- en: Python is a very powerful and widespread language, with a fully-featured standard
    library. It's said to come with *batteries included*, which means that most of
    what you will have to do will be available in the standard library.

- en: Such a big set of functions might make developers feel lost, and it's not always
    clear which of the available tools are the best for solving a specific task. For
    many of these tasks, external libraries will also be available that you can install
    to solve the same problem. So, you might not only find yourself wondering which
    class or function to use from all the features provided by the standard library,
    but you will also wonder when it's best to switch to an external library to achieve
    your goals.

- en: This book tries to provide a general overview of the tools available in the
    Python standard library to solve many common tasks and recipes to leverage those
    tools to achieve specific results. For cases where the solution based on the standard
    library might get too complex or limited, it will also try to suggest tools out
    of the standard library that can help you do the next step.

- en: Chapter 1, *Containers and Data Structures,* covers less obvious cases of data
    structures and containers provided by the standard library. While more basic containers
    such as `list` and `dict` are taken for granted, the chapter will dive into less
    common containers and more advanced usages of the built-in containers.
