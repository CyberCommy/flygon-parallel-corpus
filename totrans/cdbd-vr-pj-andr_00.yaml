- en: Google Cardboard is a low-cost, entry-level medium used for experiencing virtual
    3D environments. Its applications are as broad and varied as mobile smartphone
    applications themselves. This book gives you the opportunity to implement a variety
    of interesting projects for Google Cardboard using the native Java SDK. The idea
    is to educate you with best practices and methodologies to make Cardboard-compatible
    mobile VR apps and guide you through making quality content appropriate for the
    device and its intended users.

- en: '[Chapter 1](ch01.html "Chapter 1. Virtual Reality for Everyone"), *Virtual
    Reality for Everyone*, defines Google Cardboard, explores it, and discusses how
    it''s used and how it fits in the spectrum of VR devices.'

    Cardboard Project*, examines the structure of a Cardboard app for Android, takes
    a tour of Android Studio, and helps you build a starter Cardboard project by introducing
    the Cardboard Java SDK.'

- en: '[Chapter 3](ch03.html "Chapter 3. Cardboard Box"), *Cardboard Box*, discusses
    how to build a Cardboard Android app from scratch (based on Google''s Treasure
    Hunt sample) with a 3D cube model, transformations, stereoscopic camera views,
    and head rotations. This chapter also includes discussions of 3D geometry, Open
    GL ES, shaders, matrix math, and the rendering pipeline.'

    you build an app to launch other Cardboard apps on your phone. Rather than using
    3D graphics, this project simulates stereoscopic views in screen space and implements
    gaze-based selections.'

- en: '[Chapter 5](ch05.html "Chapter 5. RenderBox Engine"), *RenderBox Engine*, shows
    you how to create a small graphics engine used to build new Cardboard VR apps
    by abstracting the low-level OpenGL ES API calls into a suite of the `Material`,
    `RenderObject`, `Component`, and `Transform` classes. The library will be used
    and further developed in subsequent projects.'

    Solar System simulation science project by adding a sunlight source, spherical
    planets with texture mapped materials and shaders, animating in their solar orbits,
    and a Milky Way star field.'

- en: '[Chapter 7](ch07.html "Chapter 7. 360-Degree Gallery"), *360-Degree Gallery*,
    helps you build a media viewer for regular and 360-degree photos, and helps you
    load the phone''s camera folder pictures into a grid of thumbnail images and use
    gaze-based selections to choose the ones to view. It also discusses how to add
    process threading for improved user experience and support Android intents to
    view images from other apps.'

- en: '[Chapter 8](ch08.html "Chapter 8. 3D Model Viewer"), *3D Model Viewer*, helps
    you build a viewer for 3D models in the OBJ file format, rendered using our RenderBox
    library. It also shows you how to interactively control the view of the model
    as you move your head.'

- en: '[Chapter 9](ch09.html "Chapter 9. Music Visualizer"), *Music Visualizer*, builds
    a VR music visualizer that animates based on waveform and FFT data from the phone''s
    current audio player. We implement a general architecture used to add new visualizations,
    including geometric animations and dynamic texture shaders. Then, we add a trippy
    trails mode and multiple concurrent visualizations that transition in and out
    randomly.'

- en: Throughout the book, we use the Android Studio IDE development environment to
    write and build Android applications. You can download Android Studio for free,
    as explained in [Chapter 2](ch02.html "Chapter 2. The Skeleton Cardboard Project"),
    *The Skeleton Cardboard Project*. You will need an Android phone to run and test
    your projects. And it's strongly recommended that you have a Google Cardboard
    viewer to experience your apps in stereoscopic virtual reality.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book is for Android developers who are interested in learning about and
    developing Google Cardboard apps using the Google Cardboard native SDK. We assume
    that the reader has some knowledge of Android development and the Java language,
    but may be new to 3D graphics, virtual reality, and Google Cardboard. Novice developers,
    or those unfamiliar with the Android SDK, may find it hard to get started with
    this book. Those who aren't coming from an Android background may be better served
    by creating cardboard apps with a game engine like Unity.
