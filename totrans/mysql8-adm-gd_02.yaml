- en: In the previous chapter, we provided an overview of MySQL along with MySQL 8's
    new features, use cases, and limitations. MySQL is very flexible in terms of platforms,
    such as RedHat, Fedora, Ubuntu, Debian, Solaris, Microsoft Windows, and so on.
    It has the support of an API to connect with different languages, such as C, C++,
    C#, PHP, Java, Ruby, and many more. For any programming platform, the most important
    and monotonous task is to set up the environment with the necessary software tools.
    That won't be the case for MySQL 8, as this chapter is focused on setting up the
    environment with MySQL 8.

    than the MySQL installation directory, then use the `--datadir` option with the `mysqld`

    denied error. To overcome this issue, change the permission of the required files
