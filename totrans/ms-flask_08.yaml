- en: Representational State Transfer, or **REST**, is a method of transferring information
    between a client and a server. On the Web, REST is used on top of HTTP and allows
    browsers and servers to easily communicate by leveraging basic HTTP commands.
    By using HTTP commands, REST is platform and programming language agnostic, and
    decouples the client and the server for easier development. This is typically
    used in JavaScript applications that need to pull or update user information on
    the server. REST is also used to provide outside developers with a common interface
    to user data. For example, Facebook and Twitter use REST in their application
    program interface (**API**), to allow developers to get information without having
    to parse the website's HTML.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Rather than a strict standard, REST lays out a set of constraints on communications
    to define a methodology that can be implemented in many ways. These constraints
    are born out of years of trial and error with other communication protocols, such
    as **Remote Procedure Call** (**RPC**) or **Simple Object Access Protocol** (**SOAP**).
    These protocols fell by the wayside due to their strictness, verboseness, and
    the difficulty in creating APIs with them. The issues with these systems were
    identified, and REST's constraints were created to keep these issues from happening
    again.
  id: totrans-10
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The first constraint requires that the client and the server must have a separation
    of concerns. The client cannot handle permanent data storage, and the server cannot
    handle anything with the user interface.
  id: totrans-11
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The second constraint is that the server must be stateless. What this means
    is that any information that is necessary to handle requests is stored in the
    request itself or by the client. An example of the server being stateless is the
    session object in Flask. The session object does not store its information on
    the server, but stores it on the client in a cookie. The cookie is sent along
    with every request for the server to parse and determine if the necessary data
    for the requested resource is stored inside it rather than the server storing
    session information for every user.

    There are many different parts to this constraint, which are as follows:'
  id: totrans-13

    of the data.
  id: totrans-15

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    on the server. In the preceding example, the IDs passed to the client filled this
    role.

    manner. For example, one resource cannot be represented in XML and one in JSON,
    one over raw TCP and one over HTTP.
  id: totrans-17

  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    proxies, caches, and other servers and services can act between the client and
    the server as long as the final result is the same as if they were not there.

    the post you created in the browser, an error should appear. This is because our
    `Post` object had no user associated with it. In order to have Post objects assigned
    to users and for only authenticated users of the website to have permission to
    `POST` posts, we need to create an authentication system.

    data from the login could be checked. However, this would require developers who
    wish to use our API to have their program login through the web interface. We
    could also have developers send their login data with every request, but it's
    a good design practice to only send sensitive information when absolutely necessary.
    Instead, our API will provide an `auth` endpoint that allows them to send login
    credentials and get an access token back.

    which Flask uses to encode the session data on a cookie, so it should already
    be installed. The token will be a Python dictionary cryptographically signed by
    the app''s secret key containing the id of the user. This token has an expiration
    date encoded inside it that will not allow it to be used after it expires. This
    means that even if the token is stolen by a malicious user, it will only be useful
    for a limited amount of time before the client has to reauthenticate. First, a
    new parser is needed to handle parsing the username and password data:'

    allow developers to modify only those comments on a specific post by using the
    URL `http://localhost:5000/api/post/<int:post_id>/comments`.

    your website as a platform the ability to do so will increase your site's popularity,
