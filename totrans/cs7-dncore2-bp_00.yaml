- en: Welcome to *C# 7 and .NET Core 2.0 Blueprints*. The power of .NET Core 2.0 is
    illustrated by taking a *blueprint* approach to common everyday applications.
    You will learn how to work with .NET Core 2.0 while creating exciting applications
    that you can use.

    Catalogue App*, covers the new features introduced in C# 7, which allow developers
    to write less code and be more productive. We will create an eBook manager application.
    If you are like me, you have eBooks scattered all over your hard drive and some
    external drives as well. This application will provide a mechanism to bring all
    these various locations together into a virtual storage space. The application
    is functional, but it can be further enhanced to suit your needs.'

- en: '[Chapter 2](a15e9e2d-0cb8-4007-a0da-9f7152c29197.xhtml), *Cricket Score Calculator
    and Tracker*, says that object-oriented programming (OOP) is a crucial element
    of writing .NET applications. Proper OOP ensures that developers can easily share
    code between projects. You don''t have to rewrite code that has already been written.
    In this chapter, we will create an ASP.NET Bootstrap web application that keeps
    track of the cricket score of your two favorite teams. It is also with this application
    that the principles of object-oriented programming will become evident.'

    Core System Info Manager*, is all about what .NET Core is; .NET Core allows us
    to create applications that will run on Windows, macOS, and Linux. To illustrate
    this in this chapter, we will be creating a simple Information Dashboard application
    that displays information about the computer we are running on as well as the
    weather conditions at the location of that machine.'

    ASP .NET Core MVC App*, takes a look at using MongoDB with ASP.NET Core MVC by
    creating a task/bug logging application. MongoDB allows developers to be more
    productive and can easily be added to .NET Core.'

    Application*, begins by getting you to imagine having the ability to have your
    server-side code push data to your web page in real time, without the user needing
    to refresh the page. The ASP.NET SignalR library provides developers with a simplified
    method to add real-time web functionality to applications. FYI, keep this chapter
    in mind when going through [Chapter 8](d0763165-9e03-4983-89ef-4a779ca76668.xhtml),
    *Twitter Clone Using OAuth*. This is a perfect application to integrate SignalR
    into.'

    with Entity Framework Core*, discusses Entity Framework Core, which is an essential
    piece in our .NET Core education. One of the most frustrating parts of developing
    an application that needs to read data from and write data to some sort of database
    is trying to get the communication layer between your code and the database established.
    Entity Framework Core solves this easily in .NET Core applications, and this chapter
    shows you how.'

    Validation Azure Function*, shows you how to create an Azure Function and how
    to call that function from an ASP.NET Core MVC application. The Azure Function
    will just be validating an email address. Serverless computing is illustrated
    here, and the benefits will become clear while working through the chapter.'

    OAuth*, expresses that sometimes I wish I could tweak Twitter a bit to suit my
    own needs, for example, saving favorite tweets. In this chapter, we will take
    a look at how easy it is to create a basic Twitter clone using ASP.NET Core MVC.
    You can then easily add functionality to your application to customize it to your
    specific requirements.'

    ASP.NET Core*, explores Docker, which is all the rage these days, and for very
    good reason. This chapter illustrates how Docker can benefit developers. I will
    also show you how to create an ASP.NET Core MVC application and run it inside
    a Docker Container. In the last part of the chapter, we will see how we can use
    Docker Hub with GitHub to set up automated builds.'
