    recipes for optimizing your text for various types of device, as well as methods
    to embellish your typography. The technologies involved are simply CSS3 and HTML5's
    `canvas` element with JavaScript. With responsive typography, you can apply a
    number of exciting effects to your text.

    the use of the new size unit `REM`. `REM` means Root EM. This simply means that
    the size of the font is relative to the root's font size, not the parent, as with
    the `EM` unit.

    styles based on viewport's width. It loads or builds (rebuilds) on the fly for
    changes to the viewport's size. While not many in your audience are going to spend
    much time resizing your website in their browser, it is easy to spend too much
    time worrying about how your website shifts from one size to the next.
