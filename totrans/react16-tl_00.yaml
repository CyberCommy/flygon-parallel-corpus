- en: Any given technology is only as good as the tooling that supports it. React
    is no exception. Although React is just a library from creating user interfaces,
    the ecosystem that has sprung up around it means that a typical React project
    has many moving parts. Without the appropriate tooling, you end up spending a
    lot of time manually performing tasks that would be better off automated by a
    tool.

- en: React tools come in many forms. Some have been around for a while, others are
    brand new. Some are found in the browser, others are strictly command line. There
    are a lot of tools that React developers can use—I've tried to focus on the most
    powerful tools that have had a direct impact on projects that I've worked on.

    tools, moves into tools that aid with perfecting your React component design,
    and finishes with tools for deploying React applications in production.
