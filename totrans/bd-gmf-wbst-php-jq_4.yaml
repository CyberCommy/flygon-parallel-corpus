    in our system/project. In [Chapter 2](ch02.html "Chapter 2. The Framework"), *The
    Framework*, we discussed the player types outlined in Bartle's Games Test (killers,
    achievers, socializers, and explorers). We need to take a closer look at our users/players
    and their motivations so as to maximize that understanding when designing our
    gamified e-learning system. We will wrap up the chapter with some initial database
    design in MySQL so that we have all of the technologies in place to build our
    system.

    has become the standard when discussing player types in gamified systems. Bartle
    came up with the system/test in the context of video game design in the mid-1990s
    and has been ported over to the gamification arena. The model may require some
    adjustments, but it is a good start in the right direction.

    bring. We can satisfy this motivation somewhat with the leaderboard. The leaderboard,
    however, pits players against each other, which achievers wouldn't find as rewarding
    as killers would. Therefore, they need trophies. They need recognition of their
    achievements for the achievement's sake. Badges make this possible.

    On the other hand, they can''t be so linear that the player gets bored with them.
    Players in our e-learning system will receive various badges to denote their level

    limit the number of badges given for any accomplishment to a predetermined percentage
    of users. Furthermore, we will raise the threshold level for future badges as
    a predetermined percentage of users reach a badge. This increases the difficulty

    killers and achievers are moved to take action to boost their own scores on the

    explorers and how we can appeal to this gaming personality type. Explorers, like
    socializers, are looking for interaction and engagement but more with the system
    itself rather than with other players. Like achievers, they want to engage with
    the system, but not so much to accomplish goals. They are content with enjoying
    the game for the game itself. For them, the journey is the reward. Discovery is
    a primary motivator for them.

  zh: 现在我们已经有了支持VuPoint电子学习应用的基本表结构，让我们开始向应用程序添加一些基本代码。我们有三个代码将执行的地方。我们可以编写在客户端（浏览器）中使用JQuery/JavaScript运行的代码。我们可以编写在服务器上使用PHP运行的代码。我们可以编写在数据库中使用MySQL存储过程运行的代码。理论上，我们可以编写所有代码在一个地方运行，但在大多数情况下，这不仅不切实际，而且还会使我们的一些任务变得更加困难。所以问题是，“在哪里编写我们的代码最好？”以下是我们将遵循的顺序：
- en: We will write that portion of the task that adds, modifies, or deletes data
    in the database.
