    input[type=radio][name=beers]:checked ~ label.beers`. By putting together these
    two selectors and a classic `.preferences label.beers:hover` selector, we are
    now able to change the placeholder image reflecting the user interaction with
    the radio buttons. Now let's add a final cool feature. We have used the `counter-increment`

- en: In this first project, we've explored how CSS3 can enhance our forms with useful
    information derived from the markup and the status of the fields. In the next
    chapter, we'll focus our attention on buttons and how we can mimic real-world
    shapes and behavior without using images by taking full advantage of gradients
    and other CSS3 properties.
