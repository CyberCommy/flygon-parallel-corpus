- en: The innovations in the JavaScript programming language in recent years have
    been vital. For example, since 2009 the rise of Node granted developers the ability
    to use the same programming language in the browser and on the backend. The environmental
    changes haven't slowed down in 2017 as well. This book will teach you about some
    new and hot concepts that speed up the full-stack development process even more.

    faster with full-stack technologies such as Falcor or GraphQL. This book isn't
    just a guide on how to expose the API endpoints in Node and start consuming them
    with your client-side application. You will learn how to use the newest technology
    from Netflix, called Falcor. Beside that, you will learn how to set up a project
    with the use of React and Redux.
