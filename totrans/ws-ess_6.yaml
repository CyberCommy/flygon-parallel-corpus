    seen in the previous chapters. One of the biggest problems faced in application
    development is code management: how you will structure your application so that
    it will be easily readable, expandable, maintainable, and so on. In this chapter,
    we will see modern methods or tools of modern application development. Once we
    come to know about the different techniques, methods, and tools, we will be equipped
    to enhance our application.'

- en: As the application grows in size, it becomes difficult to manage when there
    are different dependencies. In an environment when there are several different
    people working on the same project, we need to take care of the versions and dependencies.
    This problem is solved by package managers. One of the most popular package managers
    for modern technologies is NPM. NPM gives you a very simple way to maintain your
    packages and install them.

    and we installed them with just a single command. The Package Manager made it
    easy to make packages of different modules of the application and publish them
    as well. There are a number of different packages available which we can utilize
    to make our application better.

    dependencies by itself using one configuration file.

    server also, which you can use to make your application better.

    applications and websites only on computers. But now things are changing; mobiles
    and tablets are coming into the picture and capturing the market. Now companies
    are launching web versions of their application or website. Due to this phase,
    developers have made the same website for mobile devices, too. This is a costly
    thing to do because it involves all the lifecycle phases of an application.

    it, as this technology is already equipped with the functionality: there are features
    in HTML5 that can help us make the same website look good or responsive. Responsive
    means that the website adapts itself as per the screen size. If it is a small
    screen, then it does not just show a smaller version of the actual website; instead
    it rescales and readjusts in such a way that all the content is readable to the
    user.'

    we have different libraries already built which help us in making highly responsive
    websites in very little time. One of the most frequently used libraries is Bootstrap.

    it provides you with a complete set of different UI controls as well.

    you won''t feel the difference, but when you start to reduce the width of the
    browser window, you will be able to notice changes. These changes are small and
    useful: the buttons become smaller but the main content is perfectly fine. And
    as you keep reducing the width, it keeps changing and gives a perfect readable
    website even in a small width, which basically shows how the website will look

    have seen how the UI changes as we change the width; this is all possible due

- en: This book has exposed us to different technologies for fast application development.
    We have seen enhancements of HTML5; we learned how WebSockets works. We have developed
    some applications based on HTML5 and WebSockets. WebSockets is one of the best
    methods of communication which provides some great features, such as full-duplex
    communication which allows the client as well as the server to push the data.
    We understood how Node.js-based servers can be very useful and easy to implement
    along with WebSocket server. We achieved and saw different examples of full-duplex
    communication using WebSockets. We got some exposure to different JavaScript-based
    libraries which provide readymade components for us to use. We have also seen
    WebSockets work on mobile devices and seen and understood the different mobile
    web design features of HTML5\. And finally, we have seen different tools and techniques
    that can help in accelerating the development process of an application. The techniques
    not only help, but also give your application a new look and feel. Managing dependencies
    is made easy using package managers. All these modern tools, the accelerated development
    offered by the MEAN stack, and responsive web design will enable you to make modern
    applications which work on all devices.
