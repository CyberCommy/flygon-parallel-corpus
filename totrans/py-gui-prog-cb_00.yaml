- en: '[Chapter 1](ch01.html "Chapter 1. Creating the GUI Form and Adding Widgets"),
    *Creating the GUI Form and Adding Widgets*, explains the steps to develop our
    first GUI in Python. We will start with the minimum code required to build a running
    GUI application. Each recipe then adds different widgets to the GUI form.'

- en: '[Chapter 2](ch02.html "Chapter 2. Layout Management"), *Layout Management*,
    explores how to arrange widgets to create our Python GUI. The grid layout manager
    is one of the most important layout tools built into tkinter that we will be using.'

- en: '[Chapter 3](ch03.html "Chapter 3. Look and Feel Customization"), *Look and
    Feel Customization*, shows several examples of how to create a good "look and
    feel" GUI. On a practical level, we will add functionality to the **Help** | **About**
    menu item we created in one of the recipes.'

- en: '[Chapter 4](ch04.html "Chapter 4. Data and Classes"), *Data and Classes*, discusses
    saving the data our GUI displays. We will start using object-oriented programming
    (OOP) in order to extend Python''s built-in functionality.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 5](ch05.html "Chapter 5. Matplotlib Charts"), *Matplotlib Charts*,
    explains how to create beautiful charts that visually represent data. Depending
    upon the format of the data source, we can plot one or several columns of data
    within the same chart.'

- en: '[Chapter 6](ch06.html "Chapter 6. Threads and Networking"), *Threads and Networking*,
    explains how to extend the functionality of our Python GUI using threads, queues,
    and network connections. This will show us that our GUI is not limited at all
    to the local scope of our PC.'

- en: '[Chapter 7](ch07.html "Chapter 7. Storing Data in Our MySQL Database via Our
    GUI"), *Storing Data in Our MySQL Database via Our GUI*, shows us how to connect
    to a MySQL database server. The first recipe in this chapter will show how to
    install the free MySQL Server Community Edition, and in the following recipes
    we will create databases, tables, and then load data into those tables as well
    as modify these data. We will also read the data back out from the MySQL server
    into our GUI.'

- en: '[Chapter 8](ch08.html "Chapter 8. Internationalization and Testing"), *Internationalization
    and Testing*, shows how to internationalize our GUI by displaying text on labels,
    buttons, tabs, and other widgets in different languages. We will start simple
    and then explore how we can prepare our GUI for internationalization at the design
    level. We will also explore several ways to automatically test our GUI using Python''s
    built-in unit testing framework.'

- en: '[Chapter 9](ch09.html "Chapter 9. Extending Our GUI with the wxPython Library"),
    *Extending Our GUI with the wxPython Library*, introduces another Python GUI toolkit
    that currently does not ship with Python. It is called wxPython, and we will be
    using the Phoenix version of wxPython which was designed to work well with Python
    3.'

- en: '[Chapter 10](ch10.html "Chapter 10. Creating Amazing 3D GUIs with PyOpenGL
    and PyGLet"), *Creating Amazing 3D GUIs with PyOpenGL and PyGLet*, shows how to
    transform our GUI by giving it true three-dimensional capabilities. We will use
    two Python third-party packages. PyOpenGL is a Python binding to the OpenGL standard,
    which is a graphics library that comes built-in with all major operating systems.
    This gives the resulting widgets a native look and feel. PyGLet is one such binding
    that we will explore in this chapter.'

- en: '[Chapter 11](ch11.html "Chapter 11. Best Practices"), *Best Practices*, explores
    different best practices that can help us to build our GUI in an efficient way
    and keep it both maintainable and extendible. Best practices are applicable to
    any good code and our GUI is no exception to designing and implementing good software
    practices.'

- en: This book is for programmers who wish to create a graphical user interface (GUI).
    You might be surprised by what we can achieve by creating beautiful, functional,
    and powerful GUIs using the Python programming language. Python is a wonderful,
    intuitive programming language, and is very easy to learn.
