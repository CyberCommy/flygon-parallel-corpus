- en: Welcome to *Multiplayer Game Development with HTML5*. This book will teach you
    how to develop games that support interacting multiple players in the same game
    world, and how to perform network programming operations in order to implement
    such systems. It covers topics such as WebSockets and client-side and server-side
    game programming in JavaScript with Node.js, latency reduction techniques, and
    handling server queries from multiple users. We will accomplish this by walking
    you through the process of developing two actual multiplayer games from start
    to finish, and it will also teach you about various topics in HTML5 game development
    in the process. The aim of the book is to teach you to create game worlds for
    multiple players who want to compete or interact through the Internet using HTML5.

- en: '[Chapter 1](ch01.html "Chapter 1. Getting Started with Multiplayer Game Programming"),
    *Getting Started with Multiplayer Game Programming*, introduces network programming,
    with emphasis on designing a multiplayer game. It illustrates the basic concepts
    of multiplayer game development by walking you through the creation of a real-time
    game of Tic Tac Toe.'

    the Environment*, describes the current state of the art in the JavaScript development
    world, including JavaScript in the server through Node.js. It also describes the
    current techniques to manage the development cycle in JavaScript with workflow
    and resource management tools, such as Npm, Bower, Grunt, and more.'

    a Snake in Real Time*, takes an existing single-player Snake game and builds in
    the ability to play with multiple players in the same game world using the tools
    heretofore described. Concepts of lobby, rooms, matchmaking, and handling queries
    from users are also described and demonstrated, which add the functionality to
    the Snake game. The chapter introduces the most powerful and widely used WebSocket
    abstraction in the industry today—socket.io.'

    Latency*, teaches you techniques to reduce network latency in order to create
    a smooth playing experience. The most common among such techniques—client prediction—is
    demonstrated and incorporated into the Snake game that is described in the previous
    chapter. The game server code is also updated for the purpose of performance by
    introducing a second update loop.'

    the Bleeding Edge*, describes the exciting opportunities that are found in game
    development on the web platform. It explains WebRTC, HTML5''s gamepad, the fullscreen
    mode, and media capture APIs. Other promised and experimental technologies and
    APIs are also described here.'

    Security and Fair Play*, covers common flaws and security vulnerabilities that
    are associated with network gaming. Here, common techniques are described and
    demonstrated, allowing you to develop games that provide a playing experience
    that is free from cheating.'
