- en: Welcome to *Clean Code in C#*. You will learn how to identify problematic code
    that, while it compiles, does not lend itself to readability, maintainability,
    and extensibility. You will also learn about various tools and patterns, along
    with ways to refactor code to make it clean.

    and Principles in C#*, looks at some good code contrasted with bad code. As you
    read through this chapter, you will come to understand why you need coding standards,
    principles, methodologies, and code conventions. You will learn about modularity
    and the design guidelines KISS, YAGNI, DRY, SOLID, and Occam''s razor.'

    and Importance*, takes you through the code review process and provides reasons
    for its importance. In this chapter, you are guided through the process of preparing
    code for review, leading a code review, knowing what to review, knowing when to
    send code for review, and how to provide and respond to review feedback.'

    and Data Structures*, covers the broad topics of class organization, documentation
    comments, cohesion, coupling, the Law of Demeter, and immutable objects and data
    structures. By the end of the chapter, you will be able to write code that is
    well organized and only has a single responsibility, provide users of the code
    with relevant documentation, and make code extensible.'

    helps you to understand functional programming, how to keep methods small, and
    how to avoid code duplication and multiple parameters. By the time you finish
    this chapter, you will be able to describe functional programming, write functional
    code, avoid writing code with more than two parameters, write immutable data objects
    and structures, keep your methods small, and write code that adheres to the Single

    using SpecFlow, and **Test-Driven Development** (**TDD**) using MSTest and NUnit.
    You will learn how to write mock (fake) objects using Moq, and how to use the
    TDD software methodology to write tests that fail, make the tests pass, and then
    refactor the code once it passes.'
