- en: Before the days of Responsive Web Design, web designers' and frontend developers'
    efforts were pretty much focused on translating print layouts into websites and
    applications. Elements and dimensions were rigid, and the need for them to adapt
    and scale wasn't part of the concepts we mandatorily have to account for today.

    our work for operating systems and browsers that support (or don't support) certain
    HTML, CSS and JavaScript technologies, UX principles, usability best practices,
    and knowing how mobile devices affect the world we live in are now an "intricate"
    part of what we do as web designers and frontend developers.

- en: In this book, I provide a lot of information, technical and conceptual, about
    how RWD provides a pathway to better websites and web apps. Installing and using
    Sass, handling images and videos, and creating a solid typographic scale to building
    responsive e-mails are a few of the content gems you'll be able to read in this
    book.

- en: '[Chapter 1](ch01.html "Chapter 1. Harness the Power of Sass for Responsive
    Web Design"), *Harness the Power of Sass for Responsive Web Design*, starts with
    the easiest walkthrough you''ll ever read on how to install Sass; then we learn
    how to make Sass "watch" our SCSS files. Then, there are easy-to-understand explanations
    about basic Sass concepts such as variables, mixins, arguments, nesting, partial
    files, the `@import` directive, source maps, and Sass comments. We also learn
    to automate vendor prefixing and automatically compile our SCSS files with Prepros.
    We talk about creating mixins to address media queries as easily as possible,
    considering how content defines the breakpoints.'

- en: '[Chapter 2](ch02.html "Chapter 2. Marking Our Content with HTML5"), *Marking
    Our Content with HTML5*, clarifies that HTML is a markup language, not code. Then,
    we talk about the most used HTML5 elements that allow us to markup our content
    semantically. Improving the accessibility of our builds with ARIA roles is also
    something we address in a simple way. We also talk about the different meta tags
    required for RWD, and then we have an example that brings everything together.'

- en: '[Chapter 3](ch03.html "Chapter 3. Mobile-first or Desktop-first?"), *Mobile-first
    or Desktop-first?*, demystifies why and when mobile-first or desktop-first should
    be used. With examples, we will learn how to retrofit a site with Adaptive Web
    Design, and of course, with RWD. We will learn about *Respond.js* and conditional
    classes in order to support legacy browsers when building mobile-first.'

- en: '[Chapter 4](ch04.html "Chapter 4. CSS Grids, CSS Frameworks, UI Kits, and Flexbox
    for RWD"), *CSS Grids, CSS Frameworks, UI Kits, and Flexbox for RWD*, helps us
    understand what a grid is, how to use it, and why. With this understanding, we
    can make sound decisions when building a website or web app. We also create a
    custom CSS grid both with the *floats* technique and then by using Flexbox. We
    will use conditional classes again to address old browsers, and with the help
    of a small script, we can take care of the quirks from IE10 with an `.ie10` specific
    selector.'

- en: '[Chapter 5](ch05.html "Chapter 5. Designing Small UIs Driven by Large Finger"),
    *Designing Small UIs Driven by Large Finger*, shows how usability and accessibility
    play a major role in this chapter. We also find explanations about the different
    sizes of our target zones, the location of our controls (links, buttons, form
    fields, and so on), and the touch zones in different devices. There are also three
    examples on how to create a menu button plus three more examples on mobile navigation
    patterns.'

    Web Design"), *Working with Images and Videos in Responsive Web Design*, is one
    of the most interesting chapters of this book because images in RWD are a "thing".
    We will talk about different ways to serve different images with the `<picture>`
    element and the `srcset` attribute. Making videos responsive with CSS, jQuery,
    and JavaScript is also addressed in this chapter. We also learn about using vector-based
    files such as icon fonts and SVGs.'

- en: '[Chapter 7](ch07.html "Chapter 7. Meaningful Typography for Responsive Web
    Design"), *Meaningful Typography for Responsive Web Design*, talks about using
    relative units being ideal because they provide scalability, and this is what
    RWD is all about. The golden egg in this chapter is that we will learn how to
    use the Modular Scale to create a harmonious typographic scale. We will also use
    *Flowtype.js* to increase the legibility of our copy.'

- en: '[Chapter 8](ch08.html "Chapter 8. Responsive E-mails"), *Responsive E-mails*,
    shows that e-mails are opened more on mobile devices than on desktops; that responsive
    e-mails have more engagement on mobile devices than nonresponsive ones; and that
    people click on e-mails on desktops more than on mobile. We will also create an
    e-mail template as an example. We''ll learn to use a CSS reset block to normalize
    those quirky e-mail clients and learn that the best width for e-mails is not more
    than 600 pixels.'
