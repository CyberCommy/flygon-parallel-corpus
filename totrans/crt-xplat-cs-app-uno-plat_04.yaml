- en: In the following four chapters, we'll look at four separate apps to show the
    different functionality available for the apps you build with Uno Platform. These
    apps are created for the same fictional business (UnoBookRail), which is part
    of the public transit authority for a fictional city (UnoBookCity).

- en: The business is responsible for all the technology used as part of the light-rail
    network in the city. Light-rail networks are electrically powered trains that
    only carry passengers and exist in many cities worldwide. They are known by names
    including Metro, Rapid Transit, Subway, Tube, Underground, U-Bahn, and many more.

    work. The following figure shows a map of the network to give you an idea of what
    we're talking about. You'll see the main line heads west from the airport along
    the river. When it reaches the center of the city, it branches north and south
    along the coast.
