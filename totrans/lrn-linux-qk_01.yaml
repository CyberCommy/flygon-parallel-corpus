    book, you will feel like you are reading a story, but this is not an ordinary
    story, it is the Linux story. In this chapter, you will learn about the origin
    of Linux and the impact of Linux on today's world. You will also learn how Linux
    is shaping the future of Computing. Finally, you will learn how to install Linux
    as a virtual machine on your computer. So without further ado, let's jump-start
    into it.

    student at the University of Helsinki in Finland, began writing a free operating
    sys­tem as a hobby! It is funny to realize now that his side hobby project became
    the world''s biggest open-source project in history. Oh, and in case you haven''t
    figured it out already, this free operating system was Linux. There are a lot
    of definitions out there on the web for open-source, and some of them are somewhat
    confusing for the inexperienced reader, so here is a simplified explanation:'
