    Games have been used historically to improve skills, and in some cases develop
    new skills. The most visible example of gamification can be of the armed forces
    the world over, who conduct "war-games" to help soldiers experience the war environment
    and use their training skills to achieve the results. These games help them use
    and develop their skills. Although gamification methods need to be used cautiously,
    the advantages outweigh the cautions if the gamified process is implemented smartly.

- en: '**Gamification** is the use of strategies and techniques used by game designers,
    in situations other than games to get people to treat those situations more like
    a game. People confuse serious games, game theory, video game design, and gamification
    as one and the same. These could be things such as fun, rules, competition, points,
    and so on, and then applying them to non-game situations.'

    but they are not designed for the purpose of having fun. They are for more practical
    uses. Flight simulators, for example, have all the mechanics, technologies, and
    design processes found in a flight video game. Developers, however, create the
    video game for entertainment purposes, while the flight simulator has a more serious
    purpose.

    itself is a game. It has all the classic game elements built into our traditional
    school system already. In almost every type of learning environment, you will
    find the idea of a reward system. This reward system could be in the form of grades
    or grade point average. Schools reward those with good performance with higher
    grades as opposed to someone who does not perform as well.

    a certain standard, the school penalizes him/her. It holds him/her back, ostracizes
    him/her, and in some cases removes him/her from the community. School is probably
    the most widely played game in the world. Unfortunately, most of the people don't
    see much fun in school today. Hence, the idea of school as a game is virtually
    nonexistent. You can expect this change, however, over the coming decades as we
    make our learning environments more engaging.

    (History 2809 [http://www.playthepast.org/?p=848](http://www.playthepast.org/?p=848)).

    not forced to participate, making it feel more like a game.

    scores from a few exams. A student starts with a 100 percent grade, and throughout
    the semester loses points until he/she settles with a final grade. Graham set
    up a system where students could earn points for different types of achievements.
    According to Graham, "I wanted students to have more opportunities to practice
    the craft of being a historian, beyond the formal assessments of the classroom."
    These achievements ranged from exam grades to participation in class. Students
    could get point achievements, such as doing outside research to visiting the professor.
    Some of the game challenges included transcribing lines of ancient papyrus, learning
    the rhetoric embedded in computer code, completing tutorials on logical fallacies,
    learning some Latin, and participating in online crowdsourcing history projects
    A student's grade was based on his/her level of achievements rather than on his/her
    exam grades only. More importantly, the system was voluntary, so one student's
    path to an A grade could be very different from another student's path to the
    same grade. Although voluntary, Graham saw about a 40 percent participation rate,
    with all students completing more than ten achievements, finishing the course
    with an A or B grade.
