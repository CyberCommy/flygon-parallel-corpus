- en: Currently, machine learning techniques are some of the hottest trends in information
    technology. They impact on every aspect of our lives, and they affect every industry
    and field. Machine learning is a cyber weapon for information security professionals.
    In this book, you will not only explore the fundamentals of machine learning techniques,
    but will also learn the secrets to building a fully functional machine learning
    security system; we will not stop at building defensive layers. We will explore
    how to attack machine learning models with adversarial learning. *Mastering Machine
    Learning for Penetration Testing* will provide educational as well as practical
    value.
