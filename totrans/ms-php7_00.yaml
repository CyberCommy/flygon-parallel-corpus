- en: The PHP language has been around for quite some time now. What started out as
    a humble set of scripts, soon turned into a powerful scripting language. The rise
    of various frameworks and platforms paved the way into the hearts of many developers.
    Over time, PHP coding standards sprung out, along with numerous testing solutions.
    These gave it the solid enterprise foothold it has today.
