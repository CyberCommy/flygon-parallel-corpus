- en: The time to start using HTML5 is now. HTML5 provides a complete application
    development framework for writing full featured applications that run in the web
    browser. Even though the HTML5 specification hasn't been fully completed yet,
    the most popular features are already widely supported by nearly every modern
    browser running on devices, from desktops to tablets to smartphones. That means
    you can write an application once and have it run on nearly any device.

    to start, then this book is for you. We will start with the basics of building
    a web application and then learn about HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript by building
    real working applications. This is not a reference book. We will keep the theory
    to a minimum and hands-on coding to a maximum.

- en: Just a few years ago, writing full-featured applications in the browser required
    other technologies such as Flash or Java Applets that ran as browser plugins.
    Like most people, I had only used JavaScript to write simple client validation
    scripts. I didn't even think it was possible to write real applications using
    JavaScript. That all started to change when a couple of things happened.

- en: Firstly, I discovered jQuery. Here was a library that made writing JavaScript
    a whole lot easier by abstracting away browser idiosyncrasies and making it very
    easy to manipulate the elements of a web page. Plus it could help us perform some
    cool actions, such as animating elements. Then about three years ago I found out
    about HTML5 while looking for a way to draw graphics primitives directly onto
    a web page. Since then I've watched HTML5 develop into a complete framework, capable
    of being used to write real applications without plugins.

- en: This book is the culmination of those past three years of writing JavaScript
    nearly every day, learning what works and what doesn't. A technical brain dump,
    if you will. The objective was to write the book that I would have liked to read
    when I started out.

    teach you the basic components of a JavaScript application by building a template
    that can be used to start writing new applications. Then we will create a tasklist
    application where we will learn how to manipulate the DOM and how to use HTML5
    Web Storage to save the state of the application.'

    to your web applications including rounded corners, shadows, and gradients. We
    will also learn how to use CSS sprites to make loading images more efficient.'

    a details section to the tasklist application. We will also learn about custom
    data attributes and learn how to use them to bind data in the view to the model.'

    will continue teaching about the canvas by showing you how to export images from
    a canvas and load images into a canvas using the new File API. Then we will get
    down to the pixel level and learn how to directly manipulate canvas image data.'

    virtual piano from the previous chapter and turn it into a game where the player
    must play the correct notes of a song at the correct time to get points. In the
    process we will learn about using JavaScript timers and animating elements.'

- en: The great thing about HTML5 is that there is no cost to use it. You don't need
    any special tools or licenses to develop web applications. However, using a good
    code editor will help you a lot, especially as you get started. There's nothing
    like autosuggest to help you remember JavaScript functions, element names, and
    styling options. And syntax highlighting is essential for making it easier to
    read code.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That said, there are a few source code editors that I can suggest if you don't
    already have one. Notepad++ is a free editor with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS syntax
    highlighting and some basic autosuggest, without a lot of overhead. I used it
    to write all of the code in this book. On the higher end, Microsoft Visual Studio
    provides very good autosuggest features but with more overhead than a basic text
    editor. Another great option is NetBeans, an open source IDE written in Java with
    good web development support.

- en: You will also need a web browser with good HTML5 support and developer tools.
    The latest versions of most browsers support the HTML5 features used in this book.
    The browser you use should depend on which has the developer tools you like most.
    I use Chrome because it has great developer tools built-in. Firefox with the Firebug
    plugin installed is also very good. For this book I use Chrome as the browser
    of choice. Internet Explorer 9 doesn't completely support all of the HTML5 features
    we will be learning and the developer tools are not as good as the others, so
    I would stay away from using it for development.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The one other thing you may need is a web server such as IIS or Apache. Most
    of the time you can open your web application right from the filesystem when in
    development. However, some HTML5 features will only work through a web server.
    I have noted the places in this book where that is the case.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book is for the programmer who has experience in other languages and wants
    to start writing HTML5 web applications. You should have some basic knowledge
    of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. For example, you should know how to write simple
    HTML documents. You should also know the basics of using CSS selectors as they
    are important to using jQuery. You do not need to know how to use jQuery as this
    book will briefly cover the basics, but it would be helpful. As long as you can
    understand and write simple JavaScript code, that should be sufficient to get
    you going. We will start off with the basics and work our way up using lots of
    examples.
