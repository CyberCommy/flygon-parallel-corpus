- en: In the last section, we covered how to develop and containerize a single microservice,
    and this section introduces the orchestration concept, making multiple services
    work in unison. In this section, Kubernetes, as an orchestrator of Docker containers,
    is explained in depth, along with practices to maximize its usage and how to deploy
    it for real-world operations.

- en: The first chapter of this section introduces Kubernetes and explains the basic
    concepts behind this tool that will be used throughout the section. Kubernetes
    has its own specific nomenclature that can initially be a bit overwhelming, so
    don't be afraid to come back to this chapter when something is not clear. It also
    covers how to install and operate a local cluster.

- en: The second chapter of this section shows how to install the developed microservices
    in a local Kubernetes cluster, using the concepts introduced in the previous chapter
    in a concrete operation. It configures a full cluster with services running and
    cooperating, while also demonstrating how to develop in this environment.

    create a cloud cluster using commercial cloud services (we use AWS services in
    this book) that is aimed at providing a service to external customers in the open
    internet. It also covers how to secure the service under proper HTTPS endpoints,
    using private Docker registries, and advanced topics such as automatic scaling
    of the cluster and practices to ensure the smooth running of containers.'

- en: The fourth chapter of this section introduces the concept of GitOps, which entails
    using a Git repository to control the cluster infrastructure, keeping any infrastructure
    change under source control, and allowing the use of common elements of Git, such
    as pull request, to control and verify the fact that infrastructure changes are
    correct.

- en: The fifth chapter of this section describes the software life cycle inside a
    single service and how adding a new feature works, since the feature is defined
    until it is running live in the existing Kubernetes cluster. This chapter shows
    practices for testing and verifying new features to introduce them into the live
    system with confidence and in an efficient manner.
