- en: If you're getting started in the field of cybersecurity—especially in offensive
    security testing (penetration testing)—it's likely that you'll encounter the Kali
    Linux operating system. Kali Linux has a lot of features and tools that make a
    penetration tester's or security engineer's job a bit easier when they're in the
    field or on a job. There are many tools, scripts, and frameworks for accomplishing
    various tasks, such as gathering information on a target, performing network scanning,
    and even exploitation, to name just a few. The challenge we face as beginners
    is learning about, and adapting to, a new environment.

    and as a penetration tester. Furthermore, you will learn how to use the Linux
    operating system to perform various tasks and become more familiar with it. Without
    understanding how Kali Linux works, you may face challenges in the later and more
    advanced chapters on penetration testing.

    The BackTrack operating system was developed and maintained by the Auditor Security
    Collection and Whax organizations back in 2006\. At the time, BackTrack was based
    on the Linux operating system, Ubuntu. Being Linux-based meant that BackTrack
    provided many opportunities for the penetration tester, with one of its benefits
    being the ability to boot from a live CD and live USB bootable media. However,
    the latest version of the BackTrack operating system is **BackTrack 5**, which
    was released in 2011 before the project was archived. In 2012, the next-generation
    operating system, and now successor to BackTrack, was announced, known as **Kali
    Linux**, which was built from the ground up. In March 2013, Kali Linux was officially
    released to the public.

    I recommend changing the default password for the root account on Kali Linux.
    To change the password, open the Terminal window and execute the `passwd` command.
    The interactive prompt will ask you to enter your new password and verify it.

- en: During the course of this chapter, we discussed the benefits of using the Kali
    Linux operating system as the preferred penetration testing distribution. We covered
    the basics of maneuvering and finding our way around the operating system, just
    as you would with any other operating system. Then, we took a look at updating
    our source file and upgrading our existing packages, and we demonstrated how to
    install a new application and remove outdated packages. Lastly, we covered how
    to use the `find`, `locate`, and `which` utilities to quickly find files and directories
    within the Kali Linux operating system.

- en: Learning the essentials of Kali Linux will prove to be fruitful in your journey
    ahead. The skills taught in this chapter will help you understand the simple things
    when using Kali Linux, some of which are often overlooked. It would be pointless
    to know how to gather information on a target but not know how to find or locate
    files and directories within the Kali Linux operating system, so learning the
    basics will take you a long way.

    which is the beginning of the reconnaissance phase in penetration testing.
