- en: Python is a dynamic but interpreted language, which comes under high-level programming
    languages. With its clear syntax and an extensive library, it is used as a general-purpose
    language. Based on Python's interpreted nature, it's often considered as a scripting
    language. Python is dominant in information security as it's less complex and
    possesses limitless libraries and third-party modules. Security experts have preferred
    Python as a language to develop information security toolkits such as w3af, sqlmap,
    and many more. Python's modular design, which help to reuse the code and code
    readability, make Python suites the preferred choice for security researchers
    and experts to write scripts and build tools for security testing.

- en: Information security tools, including fuzzers, proxies, scanners, and even the
    exploits has been written with Python. Also, Python is the language for several
    current open source penetration testing tools from volatility for memory analysis
    to libPST and for abstracting the process of examining emails. It is the right
    language to learn for an information security researcher because of the large
    number of reverse engineering and exploitation libraries available for your use.
    So, learning Python may help you in difficult situations, where you need to extend
    or tweak these tools.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this book, we will deal with how a security researcher could use these tools
    and libraries to aid his day-to-day work. The following pages will help you learn
    to detect and exploit various types of vulnerabilities, while enhancing your knowledge
    on the concepts of wireless applications and information gathering through practical
    recipes. Read on to explore a pragmatic way to penetration test using Python to
    build efficient code and save time.
