- en: The vast majority of application software is built to view and manipulate organized
    data. Even in applications that aren't explicitly *database applications*, there's
    often a need to interact with collections of data on a smaller scale, such as
    populating a combobox with options or displaying a hierarchy of settings. Without
    some sort of organizational paradigm, interactions between a GUI and a set of
    data can quickly become a nightmare of spaghetti code. The **m****odel-view**
    pattern is one such paradigm.

- en: Model-view is a software application design paradigm that implements **separation
    of concerns**. It is based on the venerable **Model-View-Controller** (**MVC**)
    pattern but differs in that the controller and view are combined into one component.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In model-view design, the **model** is the component that holds the application
    data and contains the logic for retrieving, storing, and manipulating data. The
    **view** component presents the data to the user and provides an interface for
    entering and manipulating data. By separating these components of the application,
    we keep their interdependency to a minimum, making them much easier to reuse or
    refactor.

    though you've altered the items in the list widget, the combobox items remain
    unchanged. Each widget has its own internal list model, which stores a copy of

    method. However, we can't connect our menu item directly to that method, because
    the model doesn't exist until a file is actually loaded. This wrapper method allows
    us to create a menu option without a model.

    view's `selectedIndexes()` method. These lists are sorted from upper-leftmost
    cells to lower-rightmost cells. So, for inserting above, we retrieve the row of
    the first index in the list (or 0 if the list is empty). For inserting below,
    we retrieve the row of the last index in the list (or the last index in the table
    if the list is empty). Finally, in both methods, we use the model's `insertRows()`
    method to insert one row to the appropriate location.

    using models with regular widgets and about the special model-view classes in
    Qt. You created a custom table model and rapidly built a CSV editor by exploiting
    the power of model-view classes.
