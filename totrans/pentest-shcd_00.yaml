- en: This book is all about finding buffer overflow vulnerabilities, crafting your
    own shellcode from scratch, learning the security mechanisms of the operating
    system, and exploit development. You will understand how systems can be bypassed
    both at the operating system and network levels with shellcode, assembly, and
    Metasploit. You will also learn to write and modify 64-bit shellcode along with
    kernel-level shellcode concepts. Overall, this book is a step-by-step guide that
    will take you from low-level security skills to covering loops with exploit development
    and shellcode.
