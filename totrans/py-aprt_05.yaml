    with it. By the time you get through this book, you will be able to write substantial
    Python programs, and you’ll be able to read even more complex ones. More importantly,
    you’ll have the foundation you need to go out and discover all of the more advanced
    topics in the language, and hopefully we’ll get you excited enough about Python
    to actually do so. Python is a big language with a huge eco-system of software
    built in and around it, and it can be a real adventure to discover everything
    it has to offer.
