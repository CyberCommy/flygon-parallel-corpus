- en: Whether this is your first foray into high-level object-oriented programming
    languages such as Java, or if you've been programming for some time and you're
    just looking to add Java to your repertoire, or even if you've never touched a
    line of code in your life, this book is designed to accommodate you. We'll move
    quickly and we'll not shy away from heavy subjects, but we'll begin this book
    from the very ground up and learn the concepts behind object-oriented programming
    as we go. I will consider the book to be successful if it helps you understand
    what Java programming is about, why it is important, and how you can start developing
    Java applications in NetBeans. I will be equally happy if Java becomes your favorite
    programming language!
