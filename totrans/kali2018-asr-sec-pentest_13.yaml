    in 2006 as a joint venture by several of the leading credit card companies, including
    MasterCard, Discovery, Visa, American Express, and JCB International. The PCI
    DSS (currently at version 3.2.1) applies to all institutions, merchants, and businesses
    that accept, process, transmit, and store credit card information and associated
    details. The purpose of this standard remains solely to protect merchants, service
    providers, and consumers alike from financial and goodwill losses that may be
    sustained due to breaches of data security as it relates to credit cards and associated
    **Personally Identifiable Information** (**PII**).

    to engage with the client to ensure that all the appropriate information is obtained.
    During the target scoping phase, the penetration tester will gather information
    from the client that will be used to generate target assessment requirements,
    define the parameters for testing, and the client's business objectives and time
    schedule. This process plays an important role in defining clear objectives toward
    any kind of security assessment. By determining these key objectives, you can
    easily draw a practical roadmap of what will be tested, how it will be tested,
    what resources will be allocated, what limitations will be applied, what business
    objectives will be achieved, and how the test project will be planned and scheduled.
    All of this information is finally captured in a test plan that expressly states
    what the scoping of the test will be.

    test consistency and a greater probability of success. Additionally, this process
    can also be adjusted according to the given situation and test factors. Without
    any such process, there will be a greater chance of failure, as the requirements
    gathered will have no proper definitions and procedures to follow. This can risk
    putting the entire penetration testing project in danger and may result in an
    unexpected business interruption. At this stage, paying special attention to the
    penetration testing process would make an excellent contribution toward the rest
    of the test phases and clarify the perspectives of both technical and management
    areas. The key is to acquire as much information as possible from the client beforehand
    to formulate a strategic path that reflects the multiple aspects of penetration
    testing. These may include negotiable legal terms, contractual agreement, resource
    allocation, test limitations, core competencies, infrastructure information, timescales,
    and rules of engagement. As a part of best practices, the scope process addresses
    each of the attributes that are necessary to initiate our penetration testing

    it is critical to identify all internal and external stakeholders at an early
    stage of the project and analyze their levels of interest, expectations, importance,
    and influence. A strategy can then be developed to approach each stakeholder with
    their requirements and involvement in the penetration testing project, in order

    there is a change in client requirements. If there are any unnecessary steps involved
    during the test execution, it may result in a violation of the organization''s
    policies and incur serious penalties. Additionally, based on the test type, there

    auditor does not have any penetration testing tool that can assist in the assessment
    of this new technology. For instance, imagine that a company has introduced a
    robust GZ network firewall device that sits at the perimeter and works to protect
    the entire internal network. However, its implementation of proprietary methods
    inside the firewall prevents any firewall assessment tool from working. Thus,

    by the client to control the assessment process. This can be done by limiting
    the view of an IT infrastructure to include only specific network devices and
    technologies that need assessment. Generally, this kind of restriction is introduced
    during the requirement gathering phase; for instance, testing all the devices
    behind a given network segment, except the first router. Such a restriction imposed
    by the client does not ensure the security of a router in the first place, which
    can lead to a compromise across the whole network, even if all the other network
    devices are hardened and security-assured. Thus, proper thinking is always required
    before putting any such restrictions on penetration testing.'

    carried out while gathering the client requirements. A good penetration tester's
    duty is to dissect each requirement and hold a discussion with the client to pull
    or change any ambiguous restrictions that may cause an interruption to the testing
    process or result in a security breach in the near future. These limitations can
    also be overcome by introducing highly skilled penetration testers and an advanced
    set of tools and techniques for the assessment, although, by nature, certain technology
    limitations cannot be eliminated, and you may require extra time to develop their

    all of the individual parts of the scoping process. Once these scope objectives
    have been cleared, the project manager can coordinate with the penetration testers
    to develop a formal outline that defines the project plan and schedule. Usually,
    the penetration tester can carry out this task unaided, but the cooperation of
    a client could possibly bring positive attention to that part of the schedule.
    This is important because test execution requires careful allotment of the timescale
    that should not exceed the declared deadline. Once the proper resources have been
    identified and allocated to perform certain tasks during the assessment period,
    it becomes necessary to draw a timeline depicting those resources with their key
    roles in the penetration testing process.

    The resource can be a person involved in the security assessment, or an ordinary
    source such as lab equipment, which can be helpful in penetration testing. In
    order to manage these projects efficiently and cost effectively, there are a number
    of project management tools available that can be used to achieve our mission.
    We have listed some important project management tools in the following table.
    Selecting the best one depends on the environment and testing criteria stipulations:'

    easily tracked and managed in accordance with their defined tasks and time period.
    Additionally, these tools provide other advanced features, such as generating
    an alert for the project manager if the task has been finished or the deadline
    exceeded. There are many other positive facts that encourage the use of project
    management tools during the penetration testing assignment. These include efficiency
    in delivering services on time, improved test productivity and customer satisfaction,
    increased quality and quantity of work, and flexibility to control the progress of
    the work.

    Standard** (**PCI DSS**) and its goals and requirements for organizations that
    must be PCI DSS-compliant. We also looked at the various levels of compliance
    required, depending on the volume of payment card transactions processed yearly.
    We also learned about the importance of segmentation and its impact on PCI DSS
    assessments, and then moved on to a detailed look at the scoping process.
