- en: If you have been within the software development industry for the last 20 years,
    you most certainly have heard of a programming language named Python. Created
    by Guido van Rossum, Python first appeared in 1991 and has captured the hearts
    of many software developers across the globe ever since.

    and is gaining more and more popularity every day?

- en: Well, the answer to this question is simple. Python is awesome for everything
    (or almost everything). Python is a general-purpose programming language, which
    means that you can create simple terminal applications, web applications, microservices,
    games, and also complex scientific applications. Even though it is possible to
    use Python for different purposes, Python is a language that is well known for
    being easy to learn, which is perfect for beginners as well as people with no
    computer science background.

- en: Python is a *batteries included* programming language, which means that most
    of the time you will not need to make use of any external dependencies when developing
    your projects. Python's standard library is feature rich and most of the time
    contains everything you need to create your programs, and just in case you need
    something that is not in the standard library, the PyPI (Python Package Index)
    currently contains 117,652 packages.

    about the language, and everyone in the community is always happy to help each
    other.

    year's statistics about the popularity of programming languages based on the number
    of questions the users add to the site, and Python is one of the top languages,
    only behind JavaScript, Java, C#, and PHP.

    Weather Application*, guides you through developing a terminal application that
    shows the current weather for a specific region and a forecast for the next 5
    days. This chapter will introduce you to the basic concepts of Python programming.
    You will learn how to parse command-line arguments to add more interactivity to
    programs, and you will finally see how to scrape data from websites using the
    popular Beautiful Soup framework.'

    that will get foreign exchange rates in real time from different sources and use
    the data to perform currency conversion. We will develop an API that contains
    helper functions to perform the conversions. To start with, we will use opensource
    foreign exchange rates and a currency conversion API ([http://fixer.io/](http://fixer.io/)).'
