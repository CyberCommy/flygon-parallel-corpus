- en: If you have been within the software development industry for the last 20 years,
    you most certainly have heard of a programming language named Python. Created
    by Guido van Rossum, Python first appeared in 1991 and has captured the hearts
    of many software developers across the globe ever since.

    and is gaining more and more popularity every day?

- en: Well, the answer to this question is simple. Python is awesome for everything
    (or almost everything). Python is a general-purpose programming language, which
    means that you can create simple terminal applications, web applications, microservices,
    games, and also complex scientific applications. Even though it is possible to
    use Python for different purposes, Python is a language that is well known for
    being easy to learn, which is perfect for beginners as well as people with no
    computer science background.

- en: Python is a *batteries included* programming language, which means that most
    of the time you will not need to make use of any external dependencies when developing
    your projects. Python's standard library is feature rich and most of the time
    contains everything you need to create your programs, and just in case you need
    something that is not in the standard library, the PyPI (Python Package Index)
    currently contains 117,652 packages.

- en: The Python community is welcoming, helpful, diverse, and extremely passionate
    about the language, and everyone in the community is always happy to help each
    other.

- en: If you still not convinced, the popular website StackOverflow published this
    year's statistics about the popularity of programming languages based on the number
    of questions the users add to the site, and Python is one of the top languages,
    only behind JavaScript, Java, C#, and PHP.

    Weather Application*, guides you through developing a terminal application that
    shows the current weather for a specific region and a forecast for the next 5
    days. This chapter will introduce you to the basic concepts of Python programming.
    You will learn how to parse command-line arguments to add more interactivity to
    programs, and you will finally see how to scrape data from websites using the
    popular Beautiful Soup framework.'

    Application with Spotify*, will teach you how to perform authentication with the
    Spotify API using OAuth. We will use the curses library to make the application
    more interesting and user-friendly.'

    Twitter*, will teach you how to use the Tkinter library to create beautiful user
    interfaces using Python. We will use Reactive Extensions for Python to detect
    when a vote has been made in the backend, after which, we will publish the changes
    in the user interface.'

    the Currency Conversion Tool*, will enable you to implement a currency converter
    that will get foreign exchange rates in real time from different sources and use
    the data to perform currency conversion. We will develop an API that contains
    helper functions to perform the conversions. To start with, we will use opensource
    foreign exchange rates and a currency conversion API ([http://fixer.io/](http://fixer.io/)).'

- en: The second part of the chapter will teach you how to create a command-line application
    makes use of our API to fetch data from the data sources and also get the currency
    conversion results with a few parameters.

    with Microservices*, will teach you how to use Nameko, a microservice framework
    for Python. You will also learn how to make dependency providers for external
    resources such as Redis. This chapter will also touch upon integration testing
    Nameko services and basic AJAX requests to an API.'

    5](332eca24-e97d-470d-a00f-882dbf2092aa.xhtml), *Building a Web Messenger with
    Microservices*. You will create a user authentication microservice that stores
    users in a Postgres database. Using Bcrypt, you will also learn how to store passwords
    in a database securely. This chapter also covers creating a Flask web interface
    and how to utilize cookies to store web session data. By the end of these chapters,
    you will be well equipped to create scalable and cohesive microservices.'
