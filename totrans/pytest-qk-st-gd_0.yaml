- en: 'Automated tests are a very important tool in a developer''s tool belt. Having
    a set of automated tests not only increases productivity and software quality;
    it also works as a safety net for developers and gives confidence in relation
    to code refactorings. Python comes with a standard `unittest` module that is used
    to write automated tests, but there''s an alternative: pytest. The pytest framework
    is simple to get started with, and scales from simple unit tests all the way through
    to complex integration testing. It is considered by many to be truly Pythonic
    in its approach, with simple functions, plain asserts, fixtures, plugins, and
    a whole plethora of features. More and more developers are adopting a full testing
    approach, so why not use a framework that is both simple and powerful and considered
    by many to be a true joy to use?'

- en: This book is for anyone who wants to start using pytest to improve their testing
    skills in their daily workflow. It covers everything from getting pytest installed,
    and its more important features, all the way through to tips and tricks to converting
    existing `unittest`-based suites to pytest. There are also several tips and discussions
    based on the author's many years of testing and pytest experience. We go through
    several code examples in this book and only an intermediate level of Python is
    required, although you will enjoy the book even more if you have some `unittest` experience.

    module, and finally takes a look at pytest''s main features.'

    for checking values, testing module organization, and some very useful command-line

    explains how pytest *markers* work, how to skip tests based on certain conditions,
    and discusses the difference between expected failures and flaky tests (and how
    to deal with them). Finally, we will learn how to use the `parametrize` mark to
    apply different sets of inputs to the same piece of testing code, avoiding repetition
    and inviting us to cover more input cases.'
