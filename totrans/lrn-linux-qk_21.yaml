- en: I want to congratulate you on finishing reading the book and learning over 116
    Linux commands. I hope you have enjoyed reading it as much as I have enjoyed writing
    it! Linux surely requires a curious brain, and I bet you are very courageous to
    give Linux a shot. I once read a quote that said, "Linux is user-friendly â€” it's
    just choosy about who its friends are," so I now welcome you to the elite Linux
    club.
