- en: Apache Spark is an open source, parallel processing framework that has been
    around for quite some time now. One of the many uses of Apache Spark is for data
    analytics applications across clustered computers.

- en: This book will help you implement some practical and proven techniques to improve
    aspects of programming and administration in Apache Spark. You will not only learn
    how to use Spark and the Python API to create high-performance analytics with
    big data, but also discover techniques to test, immunize, and parallelize Spark
    jobs.

- en: This book covers the installation and setup of PySpark, RDD operations, big
    data cleaning and wrangling, and aggregating and summarizing data into useful
    reports. You will learn how to source data from all popular data hosting platforms,
    including HDFS, Hive, JSON, and S3, and deal with large datasets with PySpark
    to gain practical big data experience. This book will also help you to work on
    prototypes on local machines and subsequently go on to handle messy data in production
    and on a large scale.

  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Chapter 1, *Installing Pyspark and Setting up Your Development Environment*, covers
    the installation of PySpark and learning about core concepts in Spark, including **resilient
    distributed datasets** (**RDDs**), SparkContext, and Spark tools, such as SparkConf
    and SparkShell.

- en: Chapter 2, *Getting Your Big Data into the Spark Environment Using RDDs*, explains
    how to get your big data into the Spark environment using RDDs using a wide array
    of tools to interact and modify this data so that useful insights can be extracted.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Chapter 3, *Big Data Cleaning and Wrangling with Spark Notebooks*, covers how
    to use Spark in notebook applications, thereby facilitating the effective use of
    RDDs.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Chapter 4, *Aggregating and Summarizing Data into Useful Reports*, describes how
    to calculate averages with the map and reduce function, perform faster average
    computation, and use a pivot table with key/value pair data points.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Chapter 5, *Powerful Exploratory Data Analysis with MLlib*, examines Spark's
    ability to perform regression tasks with models including linear regression and
    SVMs.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Chapter 6, *Putting Structure on Your Big Data with SparkSQL*, explains how
    to manipulate DataFrames with Spark SQL schemas, and use the Spark DSL to build
    queries for structured data operations.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Chapter 7, *Transformations and Actions*, looks at Spark transformations to
    defer computations and then considers transformations that should be avoided. We
    will also use the `reduce` and `reduceByKey` methods to carry out calculations
    from a dataset.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Chapter 8, *Immutable Design*, explains how to use DataFrame operations for
    transformations with a view to discussing immutability in a highly concurrent
    environment.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Chapter 9, *Avoid Shuffle and Reduce Operational Expenses*, covers shuffling
    and the operations of Spark API that should be used. We will then test operations
    that cause a shuffle in Apache Spark to know which operations should be avoided.

- en: Chapter 10, *Saving Data in the Correct Format*, explains how to save data in
    the correct format and also save data in plain text using Spark's standard API.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Chapter 11, *Working with the Spark Key/Value API*, discusses the transformations
    available on key/value pairs. We will look at actions on key/value pairs and look
    at the available partitioners on key/value data.

    Apache Spark jobs in different versions of Spark.
