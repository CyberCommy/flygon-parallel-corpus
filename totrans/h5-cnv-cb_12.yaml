- en: In addition to the canvas, the HTML5 specification has also introduced two exciting
    additions to the CSS3 specification—**Transitions** and **Animations**.

- en: Transitions enable developers to create simple animations that can change DOM
    element styles over a defined period of time. For example, if you mouse over a
    button and you want it to gradually fade to a different color within one second,
    you could use a CSS3 transition.

- en: Animations enable developers to create more complex animations by defining specified
    key frames which can be thought of as a series of linked transitions. For example,
    if you wanted to animate a `DIV` element by moving it up, then left, then down,
    then back to its original position, you could use a CSS3 animation and define
    a key frame for each point along the path.

- en: So, here's where people get hung up. When should you use canvas and when should
    you use CSS3 for animations? If you're a seasoned developer, I'm sure you know
    that the correct answer is "it depends". As a general rule of thumb, it's good
    practice to use CSS3 transitions and animations if you're animating DOM nodes,
    or if the animations are simple and well defined. If, on the other hand, you're
    animating something more complex such as a physics simulator or an online game,
    it would probably make more sense to use canvas.

- en: As the mobile and tablet markets continue to eat away at the traditional desktop
    and laptop markets, it's important to address the role of canvas in the mobile
    space. At the time of writing, canvas animations perform very poorly on nearly
    all mobile devices simply because they don't have powerful enough CPUs to handle
    it. Tablets typically have much better performance. There's good news though.
    In addition to software improvements and more powerful CPUs, mobile devices and
    tablets are pushing harder than ever to better leverage hardware acceleration,
    helping animations to run more smoothly. If you're considering building a graphically
    intensive web application that makes heavy use of canvas animations, make sure
    that you do a little bit of research upfront to find out the current state of
    canvas animation performance on the leading mobile devices if you plan on making
    it mobile friendly.
