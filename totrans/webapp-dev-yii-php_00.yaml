- en: This book is a step-by-step tutorial to developing a real-world application
    using the Yii web application development framework. The book attempts to mirror
    the environment of a software development team that is being tasked with building
    an online application, touching on each aspect of the software development lifecycle,
    as you build a project task management application from its conception to its
    production deployment.

- en: After a brief, general introduction to the Yii framework, and going through
    the iconic "Hello World" example, the remaining chapters break down in the same
    way as software development iterations do in real-world projects. We begin with
    creating a working application with a valid, tested connection to a database.

- en: We then move on to defining our main database entities and domain object model,
    and become familiar with Yii's **Object Relational Mapping** (**ORM**) layer *Active
    Record*. We learn how to lean on Yii's code generation tools to automatically
    build our create/read/update/delete (CRUD) functionality against our newly created
    models. We also focus on how Yii's form validation and submission model works.
    By the end of [Chapter 5](ch05.html "Chapter 5. Managing Issues"), *Managing Issues*,
    you will have a working application that allows you to manage the projects and
    issues (tasks) within those projects.

- en: We then turn to the topic of user management. We learn about the built-in authentication
    model within Yii to assist with the application login and logout functionality.
    We take a deep dive into the authorization model, first taking advantage of Yii's
    simple access control model and then implementing the more sophisticated, **role-based
    access control** (**RBAC**) framework that Yii provides.

- en: By the end of [Chapter 7](ch07.html "Chapter 7. User Access Control"), *User
    Access Control*, all of the basics of a task-management application are in place.
    The next several chapters begin to focus on additional user features, user experience,
    and design. We add user comment functionality, introducing a reusable, content
    portlet architecture approach in the process. We add in an RSS web feed and demonstrate
    how easy it is to integrate other third-party tools and frameworks within a Yii
    application. We take advantage of Yii's theming structure to help streamline and
    design the application, and then introduce Yii's internationalization (`I18N`)
    features so that the application can be adapted to various languages and regions
    without engineering changes.

- en: In the final chapter, we turn our focus to preparing the application for production
    deployment. We introduce ways to optimize performance and improve security, to
    prepare the application for a production environment.

- en: '[Chapter 1](ch01.html "Chapter 1. Meet Yii"), *Meet Yii*, provides you with
    a brief history of Yii, an introduction to the **Model View Controller** (**MVC**)
    application architecture, and you are introduced to the typical request life cycle
    as it makes its way from the end user through the application, and finally as
    a response back to the end user.'

- en: '[Chapter 2](ch02.html "Chapter 2. Getting Started"), *Getting Started*, is
    dedicated to downloading and installing the framework, creating a new Yii application
    shell, and introducing Gii, Yii''s powerful and flexible code generation tool.'

- en: '[Chapter 3](ch03.html "Chapter 3. The TrackStar Application"), *The TrackStar
    Application*, is where the TrackStar application is introduced. This is an online,
    project-management and issue-tracking application that you will be building throughout
    the remaining chapters. Here you learn how to connect a Yii application to an
    underlying database. You also learn how to run the interactive shell from the
    command line. The last part of this chapter is focused on providing an overview
    of unit and functional testing within a Yii application, and provides a concrete
    example of writing a unit test in Yii.'

- en: '[Chapter 4](ch04.html "Chapter 4. Project CRUD"), *Project CRUD*, helps you
    to start interacting with the database, to begin adding features to the database-driven
    Yii application TrackStar. You learn how to use Yii Migrations for database change
    management, and we use the Gii tool to create model classes and also to build
    out create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) functionality using the model class.
    The reader is also introduced to configuring and performing form field validation
    in this chapter.'

- en: '[Chapter 5](ch05.html "Chapter 5. Managing Issues"), *Managing Issues*, explains
    how additional related database tables are added to the TrackStar application,
    and how the reader is introduced to the relational Active Record in Yii. This
    chapter also covers using controller filters to tap into the application life
    cycle in order to provide pre-action and post-action processing. The official
    Yii extension library Zii is introduced, and we use Zii widgets to enhance the
    TrackStar application.'

    Management and Authentication*, explains how to authenticate users in a Yii. While
    adding the ability to manage users in the TrackStar application, the reader learns
    to take advantage of *Behaviors* in Yii, which provide an extremely flexible approach
    to sharing common code and functionality across your Yii components. This chapter
    also covers the Yii authentication model in detail.'

    is dedicated to Yii''s authorization model. First we cover the simple access control
    features, which allow you to easily configure access rules for the controller
    actions that are based on several parameters. Then we look at how role-based access
    control (RBAC) is implemented in Yii, which allows a much more robust authorization
    model for complete access control based on hierarchical model of roles, operations,
    and tasks. Implementing role-based access control into the TrackStar application
    also introduced the reader to using the console command in Yii.'

    helps demonstrate how to implement the feature for allowing users to leave comments
    on projects and issues in the TrackStar application; we introduce how to configure
    and use a statistical query relation, how to create highly reusable user interface
    components called *Widgets*, and how to define and use named scopes in Yii.'

    libraries in Yii applications, and shows you how to use the URL management features
    of Yii to customize your applications'' URL format and structure.'

    Good*, helps you learn more about the views in Yii, and how to use layouts to
    manage markup and content shared across your application pages. *Theming* is also
    introduced, as we show how easy it is to give a Yii application a completely new
    look without having to alter any of the underlying engineering. We then take a
    look at internationalization (`i18n`) and localization (`l10n`) in Yii as language
    translation is added to our TrackStar application.'
