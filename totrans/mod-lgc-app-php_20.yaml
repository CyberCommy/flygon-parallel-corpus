- en: This appendix shows a version of the page script from Appendix B after being
    converted to use Gateway classes. Note how very little of it has changed. Even
    though the SQL statements have been removed, the domain business logic remains
    embedded in the page script.

- en: 'The Gateway classes are provided below the page script, and show a conversion
    to PDO-style bound parameters. Also note that there have been minor modifications
    to the `if()` conditions in the page script: whereas previously they checked to
    see if a query succeeded, they now check for a return value from the Gateway.'
