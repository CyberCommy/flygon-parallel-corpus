- en: The vast majority of the previous chapters have been devoted to the tools and
    techniques available to the penetration tester for testing either remote or local
    networks. These tools require access to these networks through a physical connection.
    NetHunter has the same ability. Utilizing a combination of a USB Android adapter
    and a USB Ethernet adapter, the penetration tester can connect directly into a
    wall jack or, if they are able to gain access to network hardware, directly into
    a switch.

  zh: 前面大部分章节都致力于介绍渗透测试人员用于测试远程或本地网络的工具和技术。这些工具需要通过物理连接访问这些网络。NetHunter也具有相同的能力。利用USB
    Android适配器和USB以太网适配器的组合，渗透测试人员可以直接连接到墙壁插座，或者如果他们能够获得网络硬件的访问权限，可以直接连接到交换机。
- en: This deployment strategy is good for those testers who may want to surreptitiously
    gain access to areas without the bulk of a laptop. Using a Nexus smartphone or
    even a small tablet, the penetration tester can connect to the physical network,
    compromise a local system and set up persistence there, and move on. This approach
    is also useful when testing the security around publicly available network jacks.

    the native USB support found in the Android OS. This gives a penetration tester
    the ability to connect the NetHunter platform directly to hosts such as laptops
    and desktops. This ability allows the penetration tester to utilize tools that
    carry out human interface device attacks. In these attacks, the penetration tester
    is able to leverage tools that allow for connection to host devices and mimic
    what are known as **Human Interface Devices** (**HIDs**). HIDs are devices such
    as keyboards and mice that connect to the host via USB.

  zh: NetHunter平台相对于Kali Linux平台的一个优势是在Android OS中找到的本机USB支持。这使得渗透测试人员能够将NetHunter平台直接连接到诸如笔记本电脑和台式机之类的主机。这种能力允许渗透测试人员利用执行人机界面设备攻击的工具。在这些攻击中，渗透测试人员能够利用允许连接到主机设备并模拟所谓的**人机界面设备**（**HID**）的工具。HID是诸如键盘和鼠标之类的设备，通过USB连接到主机。
- en: HID attacks use this feature to force the host system to perform commands or
    to download payload scripts directly to the system. What makes this attack significantly
    more difficult to stop is that event with data loss prevention controls that do
    not allow USB storage devices to connect, HID devices are allowed.

    the ability to be discreet. This is a useful advantage if you are tasked with
    testing the wireless security of a site while trying to maintain a level of covertness.
    Sitting in the lobby of a target location with your laptop open and external antenna
    attached may attract some unwanted attention. Rather, deploying NetHunter on a
    Nexus 5 phone and having a discrete external antenna hidden behind a newspaper
    or day planner is a better way to keep a low profile. Another key advantage of
    the NetHunter platform in conducting wireless penetration testing is the ability
    to cover a wider area, such as a campus environment, without having to cart around
    a large laptop.

    the fake access point. Next, you can configure the BSSID to a MAC that mimics
    an actual access point's. In addition, we can also configure the SSID to broadcast
    any access-point identification. The other settings involve attacking using the

    can be used leverages this tool and a vulnerability found in a number of mobile
    devices. Many mobile devices are automatically configured to connect to any previously
    connected-to network. This automatic connection does not look at the MAC address
    of a wireless access point, but rather the SSID that is being broadcast. In this
    scenario, we can call our Mana evil AP a common SSID found at locations. As people
    pass by, their mobile devices will automatically connect, and as long as they

- en: This attack is useful if you are physically within a location and observe open
    workstations. You can configure a number of different commands and then simply
    connect your NetHunter platform to the system and execute. This can include more
    complex attacks using PowerShell or other scripting attacks.

    attacks as seen previously. USB Rubber Ducky scripts can be downloaded from Hak5's
    very own Darren Kitchen's GitHub page at [https://github.com/hak5darren](https://github.com/hak5darren)
    and loaded into the NetHunter HID tool in the Convert tab.

- en: The Kali NetHunter platform has a great deal of functionality in relation to
    its size. The most distinct advantage for the penetration tester is that the tools
    and techniques, with some variation, are basically the same in both Kali Linux
    and NetHunter. This reduces the necessary time to learn a new set of tools, while
    giving the penetration tester the ability to run penetration tests from a phone
    or tablet. This allows the tester the ability to get closer to a target organization,
    while allowing for some ability to obfuscate some of their actions. Adding attacks
    such as the HID further allows the penetration tester to perform attacks that
    would not be accomplished without other tools. NetHunter is an excellent platform
    to include in your penetration testing kit.
