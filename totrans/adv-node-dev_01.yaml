    have a local connection for your local database, and you might have a connection
    to a real URL where your actual production data is stored. We'll get into all
    that later.

- en: In this chapter, you downloaded and ran the MongoDB database server. This means
    that we have a local database server we can connect to from our Node application.
    We also installed Robomongo, which lets us connect to our local database so that
    we can view and manipulate data. This comes in handy when you're debugging or
    managing data, or doing anything else with your Mongo database. We'll be using
    it throughout the book, and you'll begin to see why it's valuable in the later
    chapters. For now though, you are all set up. You are ready to continue on and
    start building the Todo API.

  zh: 在这一章中，你下载并运行了MongoDB数据库服务器。这意味着我们有一个本地数据库服务器，可以从我们的Node应用程序连接到它。我们还安装了Robomongo，它让我们连接到本地数据库，这样我们就可以查看和操作数据。当你调试或管理数据，或者对你的Mongo数据库进行其他操作时，这将非常方便。我们将在整本书中使用它，你将在后面的章节中开始看到它为什么是有价值的。不过，现在你已经准备好了。你可以继续开始构建Todo
    API了。
