    for low-latency searches and faster indexes/s. For the cloud, most providers have
    some sort of SSD offering that can be used with Elasticsearch. Make sure that
    at least 500 IOPS are provisioned for optimal performance.

    IOPS—or an E10 as a lower cost alternative that delivers the same result.

- en: Logstash is not heavy on CPU nor RAM, but this depends entirely on how many
    sources are feeding Logstash data since, for each event that Logstash parses,
    there is some overhead required to complete the process. If Logstash is to be
    installed on its own (with no other components on the same system), anything above
    one vCPU and 2 GBs of RAM should suffice for small/testing deployments. Ideally,
    the actual usage should be monitored and the system tuned accordingly. Logstash
    by default has in-memory queues that are used to store events temporarily; this
    behavior can be changed to use persistent queues when processing events. This
    allows for persistent consistency and avoids data loss during an outage. Additionally,
    having persistent queues helps to absorb bursts of events by acting as a buffer
    between the clients and Logstash.

- en: 'When using persistent queues for storage capacity, the `/var/lib/logstash`
    directory needs to be able to store events while being processed by Logstash.
    The amount of space depends on two factors: the egress speed when sending data
    to Elasticsearch and the number of events being sent to Logstash. The minimum
    would be 1 GB and the space needs to be increased accordingly when the number
    of sources is increased.'

    accessing the dashboard. The amount of resources allocated to Kibana needs to
    be based on the intended usage—for example, what is the expected user base? How
    many of those users will access Kibana at the same time?

    JVM. One vCPU and 2 GB of RAM is enough for several users, but once more users
    start using the dashboard, RAM will be the first resource to become a bottleneck.

    by the usage and the number of sources. Regarding software, the primary requirement
    is Java; since all of the components use the JVM, either the open JDK or the official
    JDK can be used.

- en: In this chapter, we went through the requirements that are needed when designing
    an Elastic Stack using Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana. For Elasticsearch,
    we determined that the minimum CPU requirement is two vCPUs for small setups,
    and the CPU speed should be kept above 2 GHz. If these minimum requirements are
    not met, Elasticsearch will take longer to start up and will perform more slowly.
    This manifests as a decrease in the number of indexes per second and an increased
    search latency, both of which are things that need to be avoided in order for
    us to be able to take full advantage of the near-instant searches that Elasticsearch
    provides.

- en: Memory sizing is probably the most important specification when designing an
    Elasticsearch setup. Part of the system memory will be used for the filesystem
    cache (also known as the page cache), which helps with searches and indexes per
    second. Swapping is not recommended, as it is considered extremely slow when compared
    to actual RAM access, and so swapping should be disabled on Elasticsearch nodes.
    If the correct memory requirements are not met, Elasticsearch will fail to start
    altogether since there will not be enough memory for the JVM to start. If, on
    the other hand, enough memory is present to start the JVM, but the load increases
    over time and the system runs out of memory, the OOM or out-of-memory killer will
    be engaged to avoid a system crash that would lead to a failure of the application.
    The very minimum amount of RAM required is 2.5 GB, but resource constraints will
    be seen relatively quickly.

- en: Storage capacity and performance play an important role when setting up Elasticsearch.
    The capacity depends on the amount of data that needs to be kept and the number
    of sources configured. Latency needs to be kept to a minimum in order for our
    searches to be fast. Ideally, SSD should be used.

    GB of RAM for each component. For Logstash, there is a space requirement for the
    persistent queues.
