- en: Welcome to *Mastering Ansible*, your fully updated guide to the most valuable
    advanced features and functionalities provided by Ansible—the automation and orchestration
    tool. This book will provide you with the knowledge and skills required to truly
    understand how Ansible functions at a fundamental level, including all the latest
    features and changes since the release of version 3.0\. In turn, this will allow
    you to master the advanced capabilities needed to tackle the complex automation
    challenges of today and the future. You will gain knowledge of Ansible workflows,
    explore use cases for advanced features, troubleshoot unexpected behavior, extend
    Ansible through customization, and learn about many of the new and important developments
    in Ansible, especially around infrastructure and network provisioning.

- en: To follow the examples provided in this book, you will need access to a computer
    platform capable of running Ansible. Currently, Ansible can be run on any machine
    with Python 2.7 or Python 3 (versions 3.5 and higher) installed (Windows is supported
    for the control machine, but only through a Linux distribution running in the
    **Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)** layer available on newer versions—see [*Chapter
    4*](B17462_04_Final_JC_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor078), *Ansible and Windows – Not
    Just for Linux*, for details). Operating systems supported include (but are not
    limited to) Red Hat, Debian, Ubuntu, CentOS, macOS, and FreeBSD.
