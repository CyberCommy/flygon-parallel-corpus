- en: Node.js is one of the present day's most popular technologies. Its growing community
    is known to produce a large number of modules every day. These modules can be
    used as building blocks for server-side applications. The fact that we use the
    same language (JavaScript) on both the server- and client-side make development
    fluent.

- en: This book contains 11 chapters that contain a step-by-step guide to building
    a social network. Systems such as Facebook and Twitter are complex and challenging
    to develop. It is nice that we will learn what Node.js is capable of, but it is
    going to be much more interesting if we do that within a concrete context. The
    book covers basic phases such as the architecture and management of the assets'
    pipeline, and it discusses features such as users' friendship and real-time communication.
