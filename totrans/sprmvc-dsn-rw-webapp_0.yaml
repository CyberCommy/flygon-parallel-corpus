- en: In a world where all our applications are connected to each other, we need to
    interact with social media to promote our products and complex systems, to provide
    great value for our users. Until recently, all this was a distant and complicated
    world for Java developers. With the birth of Spring Boot and the democratization
    of cloud platforms, we can now create amazing applications and make them available
    to everyone in record time, without spending a penny. The goal of Spring is to
    simplify enterprise application development.

    An application with a lot of neat features, such as internationalization, form
    validation, distributed sessions and caches, social login, multithreaded programming,
    and many more. It covers the most important concepts and features of Spring Framework
    and a few of its critical subprojects that are necessary for building modern web
    applications.

    shows you how to develop your own full-fledged applications with Spring. It includes
    real-world examples that will also help you work with full-duplex real-time communication
    channels using WebSocket. You’ll get an insight into utilizing the power of Spring
    Expression Language in your applications for higher maintainability. It also covers
    the breadth and depth of Spring MVC, the WebSocket technology, Spring Data, and
    Spring Security with various authentication and authorization mechanisms.'

    teaches to work on Spring MVC’s product design and further developing a responsive
    frontend. You will walk through the separation of concerns driven by the microservices
    principles. It also shows you how to configure your Entities to reflect your domain
    needs, and discover Spring Data repositories. Finally you will learn how to set
    up and organize different levels of automated-tests, including logging and monitoring.'

    MVC 4*, takes you on a journey from developing your own web application to uploading
    it on the cloud. Starting with your own project, you will develop an advanced-level
    interactive application that can handle file uploads as well as complex URLs,
    you will dive into the inner workings of Spring MVC and the principles of modern
    web architectures. Finally you will see how to secure your application before
    releasing it on cloud.'
