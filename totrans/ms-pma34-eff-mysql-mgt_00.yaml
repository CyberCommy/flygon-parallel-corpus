- en: phpMyAdmin is an open source web interface that handles the administration of
    MySQL. It can perform various tasks such as creating, modifying, or deleting databases,
    tables, columns, or rows. It can also execute SQL statements or manage users and
    their permissions. When it comes to exploiting phpMyAdmin to its full potential,
    even experienced developers and system administrators search for tutorials to
    accomplish their tasks.

    step-by-step practical guide that walks you through every facet of this legendary

- en: This book jump starts with installing and configuring phpMyAdmin, and then looks
    into phpMyAdmin's features. This is followed by configuring authentication in
    phpMyAdmin and setting parameters that influence the interface as a whole, including
    the new user preferences feature. You will first create two basic tables and then
    edit, delete data, tables, and databases. As backups are crucial to a project,
    you will create up-to-date backups and then look into importing the data that
    you have exported. You will also explore the various search mechanisms and query
    across multiple tables.

    both with relation view and the Designer panel. Some queries are out of the scope
    of the interface; you will enter SQL command to accomplish these tasks.

    MySQL replication to improve performance and data security. You will also store
    queries as bookmarks for their quick retrieval. Towards the end of the book you
    will learn to document your database, track changes made to the database, and
    manage user accounts using phpMyAdmin server management features.
