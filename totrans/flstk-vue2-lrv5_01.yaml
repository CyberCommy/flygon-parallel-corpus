- en: At the time of writing in late 2017, Vue.js is at version 2.5\. In less than
    four years from its first release, Vue has become one of the most popular open
    source projects on GitHub. This popularity is partly due to its powerful features,
    but also to its emphasis on developer experience and ease of adoption.

- en: The core library of Vue.js, like React, is only for manipulating the view layer
    from the MVC architectural pattern. However, Vue has two official supporting libraries, Vue
    Router and Vuex, responsible for routing and data management respectively.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Vue is not supported by a tech giant in the way that React and Angular are and
    relies on donations from a small number of corporate patrons and dedicated Vue
    users. Even more impressively, Evan You is currently the only full-time Vue developer,
    though a core team of 20 more developers from around the world assist with development,
    maintenance, and documentation.

    the view automatically updates to reflect that change.

    custom elements.

- en: Single-file components
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A drawback of using components is that you need to write your template in a
    JavaScript string outside of your main HTML file. There are ways to write template
    definitions in your HTML file, but then you have an awkward separation between
    markup and logic.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'A convenient solution to this is **single-file components**:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[PRE10]'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_PRE
- en: These files have the `.vue` extension and encapsulate the component template,
    JavaScript configuration, and style all in a single file.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Of course, a web browser can't read these files, so they need to be first processed
    by a build tool such as Webpack.

    direct use in a browser. Vue is also available as an NPM module for use in more
    sophisticated projects, including a build tool such as Webpack.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you're unfamiliar with Webpack, it's a module bundler that takes all your
    project assets and bundles them up into something you can provide to the browser.
    In the bundling process, you can transform those assets as well.

- en: Server-side rendering
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Server-side rendering is a great way to increase the perception of loading speed
    in full-stack apps. Users get a complete page with visible content when they load
    your site, as opposed to an empty page that doesn't get populated until JavaScript
    runs.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Say we have an app built with components. If we use our browser development
    tool to view our page DOM *after* the page has loaded, we will see our fully rendered
    app:'

    when sent by the server, you''ll see it just has our mount element:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[PRE12]'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_PRE
- en: Why? Because JavaScript is responsible for building our page and, ipso facto,
    JavaScript has to run before the page is built. But with server-side rendering,
    our `index` file includes the HTML needed for the browser to build a DOM before
    JavaScript is downloaded and run. The app does not load any faster, but content
    is shown sooner.

    giving you virtual pages. For example, `mydomain.com/` might be the front page
    of a blog and have a component hierarchy like this:'

    just swapping the middle component to reflect the state of the URL, which is exactly
    what Vue Router does.

    the user saves or unsaves an item. You might name this event `toggleSaved`. Vue
    Devtools lets you see the particulars of this event as it occurs.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We can also revert to any previous state of the data without having to touch
    the code or reload the page. This function, called *Time Travel Debugging*, is
    something you'll find very useful for debugging complex UIs.
