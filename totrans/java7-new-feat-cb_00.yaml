- en: With the release of Java 7, numerous new features have been added that significantly
    improve the developer's ability to create and maintain Java applications. These
    include language improvements, such as better exception handling techniques, and
    additions to the Java core libraries, such as new threading mechanisms.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This cookbook covers these new features using a series of recipes. Each recipe
    addresses one or more new features and provides a template for using these features.
    This should make it easier to understand the features along with when and how
    they can be used. Step-by-step instructions are provided to guide the reader through
    the recipes and are followed by an explanation of the resulting code.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The book starts with a discussion of the new language enhancements, which is
    followed by a series of chapters, each addressing a specific area such as file
    and directory management. The reader is assumed to be familiar with the features
    of Java 6\. The book does not need to be read in sequential order, which enables
    the reader to choose the chapters and recipes that are of interest. However, it
    is recommended that the reader cover the first chapter, as many of the features
    found there will be used in subsequent recipes. If other new Java 7 features are
    used in a recipe, then cross references are provided to the related recipes.
