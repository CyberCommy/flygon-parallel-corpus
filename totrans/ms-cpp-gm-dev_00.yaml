- en: Although many languages are now being used to develop games, C++ remains the
    standard for professional development. The vast majority of libraries, engines,
    and toolchains are still being developed strictly in C++. Known for its performance
    and reliability, C++ continues to be the best option for true cross-platform compatibility.

- en: By picking up this book, you are beginning your journey to mastering this powerful
    language. Although the journey will be long, it will be filled with discovery!
    Even after the countless hours I have spent working with C++, I still find myself
    filled with joy at finding new techniques and approaches. In this book, I want
    to give you the tools and understanding that will prepare you for continuing this
    learning journey. While new and flashy tools and engines will arise and potentially
    fall, having a strong understanding of how games, their tools, and engines are
    developed at a low level will provide you with valuable knowledge you can always
    lean on.

- en: This book is intended for intermediate to advanced C++ game developers who are
    looking to take their skills to the next level and learn the deep concepts of
    3D game development. The reader will learn the key concepts used in the development
    of AAA-level games. Advanced topics, such as library creation, artificial intelligence,
    shader techniques, advanced effects and lighting, tool creation, physics, networking,
    and other critical game systems, will be covered throughout the journey.

- en: '[Chapter 1](89c6ce5a-45ed-4161-aa86-1bc309f69102.xhtml), *C++ for Game Development*,
    covers some of the more advanced C++ topics used in modern game development. We
    will look at inheritance and polymorphism, pointers, referencing, and the common
    STL generic containers. The concept of templating and building generic code with
    class, function, and variable templates. Type inference and the new language keywords
    auto and decltype and their uses in combination with the new return value syntax.
    Finally, we will close out the chapter by looking at some core game patterns used
    today.'

    will teach the advanced topic of shareable libraries. We will look at the different
    types of libraries available. We will walk through the various ways you can create
    your own shareable libraries.'

- en: '[Chapter 3](00070916-c402-4eb3-88d6-f3e02a4d8455.xhtml), *Building a Strong
    Foundation*, will take a look at the different methods of using object-oriented
    programming and polymorphism to create a reusable structure for all your game
    projects. We will walk through the differences in helper, managers, and interfaces
    classes with examples from real code.'

    Pipeline*, will cover a very important part of development, the handling of assets.
    We will take a look at the process of importing, processing, and managing content,
    such as sound, images, and 3D objects. With this groundwork system in place, we
    can move on to rounding out the rest of the systems needed for game development.'

    Systems*, will cover a lot of ground and make strong progress in developing the
    core game systems needed to develop professional-grade projects. By the end of
    the chapter, we will have our own custom game state system that can be adopted
    by many of the other components in the game engine itself. We will develop our
    own custom camera system while building an understanding of how cameras work at
    a lower level. Finally, we will look at how we can add complete third-party game
    systems to our projects by adding the Bullet physics engine to our example engine.'

    User Interface*, will discuss the different aspects needed to create GUI. We will
    walk through its implementation, diving deep into the core architecture behind
    a working GUI. We will develop a panel and an element architecture complete with
    anchor points for controlling positioning. We will implement a user input structure
    using the observer design pattern and round it out by coding up the rendering
    pipe needed to display the GUI elements on the screen.'

    will cover the basics of working with shaders. We will learn how we can build
    a compiler and link abstraction layers to save us time. We will gain knowledge
    about lighting techniques theories and how we can implement them in shader language.
    Finally, we will close out the chapter by looking at other uses for shaders such
    as creating particle effects.'

    Lua in your game projects. Then, we will build on that knowledge to examine ways
    of implementing dialog and quest systems into our example engine.'

    will cover a large field of study in a short period of time. We will develop a
    basic definition of what game AI really is, and for that matter, what it is not.
    We will also look at expanding the decision-making functions with the inclusion
    of AI techniques. We will cover how AI agents'' movements can be controlled through
    the use of steering forces and behavior. Finally, we will cap off the chapter
    by looking at the use of pathfinding algorithms to create paths from point to
    point for our AI agents.'

    take big steps in the understanding of how multiplayer is implemented at a low
    level. You will learn about the TCP/IP stack and the different network topologies
    in use for game development. We looked at using UDP and TCP protocols in order
    to pass data to and from a client-server setup. Finally, we will look at some
    of the issues faced by developers when they start to implement multiplayer features.'

    you with a great testing bed for your experience ideas. You will learn how to
    handle multiple view frusta and various hardware options, and finally look at
    how we could add VR support to our example engine using the OpenVR SDK.'
