- en: In this section, we will go through the history of databases and how we arrived
    at the need for non-relational databases. We will also learn how to model our
    data so that storage and retrieval from MongoDB can be as efficient as possible.
    Even though MongoDB is schemaless, designing how data will be organized into documents
    can have a great effect in terms of performance.
