- en: Algorithmic trading relies on computer programs that execute algorithms to automate
    some, or all, elements of a trading strategy. Algorithms are a sequence of steps
    or rules to achieve a goal and can take many forms. In the case of **machine learning**
    (**ML**), algorithms pursue the objective of learning other algorithms, namely
    rules, to achieve a target based on data, such as minimizing a prediction error.

  zh: 算法交易依赖于执行算法的计算机程序，以自动化一些或所有交易策略的元素。算法是为实现目标而采取的一系列步骤或规则，可以采用多种形式。在机器学习的情况下，算法追求学习其他算法的目标，即基于数据学习规则，例如最小化预测误差。
- en: These algorithms encode various activities of a portfolio manager who observes
    market transactions and analyzes relevant data to decide on placing buy or sell
    orders. The sequence of orders defines the portfolio holdings that, over time,
    aim to produce returns that are attractive to the providers of capital, taking
    into account their appetite for risk.

  zh: 这些算法编码了投资组合经理的各种活动，观察市场交易并分析相关数据，以决定下达买入或卖出订单。订单的顺序定义了投资组合持有的资产，随着时间的推移，旨在产生对资本提供者有吸引力的回报，同时考虑他们对风险的偏好。
- en: Ultimately, the goal of active investment management consists in achieving alpha,
    that is, returns in excess of the benchmark used for evaluation. The fundamental
    law of active management applies the **information ratio** (**IR**) to express
    the value of active management as the ratio of portfolio returns above the returns
    of a benchmark, usually an index, to the volatility of those returns. It approximates
    the information ratio as the product of the **information coefficient** (**IC**),
    which measures the quality of forecast as their correlation with outcomes, and
    the breadth of a strategy expressed as the square root of the number of bets.

  zh: 最终，主动投资管理的目标在于实现超额收益，即超过用于评估的基准的回报。主动管理的基本法则将信息比率（IR）应用于表达主动管理的价值，即投资组合回报超过基准回报的比率，通常是指数，与这些回报的波动性。它将信息比率近似为信息系数（IC）的乘积，IC衡量了预测的质量，即它们与结果的相关性，以及策略的广度，表达为投注数量的平方根。
- en: Hence, the key to generating alpha is forecasting. Successful predictions, in
    turn, require superior information or a superior ability to process public information.
    Algorithms facilitate optimization throughout the investment process, from asset
    allocation to idea-generation, trade execution, and risk management. The use of
    ML for algorithmic trading, in particular, aims for more efficient use of conventional
    and alternative data, with the goal of producing both better and more actionable
    forecasts, hence improving the value of active management.

  zh: 因此，产生超额收益的关键在于预测。成功的预测反过来需要优越的信息或优越的处理公共信息的能力。算法促进了整个投资过程的优化，从资产配置到创意生成、交易执行和风险管理。特别是利用机器学习进行算法交易，旨在更有效地利用传统和替代数据，以期产生更好和更具操作性的预测，从而提高主动管理的价值。
- en: Historically, algorithmic trading used to be more narrowly defined as the automation
    of trade execution to minimize costs as offered by the sell side, but we will
    take a more comprehensive perspective since the use of algorithms, and ML, in
    particular, has come to impact a broader range of activities from idea generation
    and alpha factor design to asset allocation, position sizing, and the testing
    and evaluation of strategies.

- en: If you are reading this, then you are probably aware that ML has become a strategic
    capability in many industries, including the investment industry. The explosion
    of digital data that drives much of the rise of ML is having a particularly powerful
    impact on investing, which already has a long history of using sophisticated models
    to process information. The scope of trading across asset classes implies that
    a vast range of new, alternative data may be relevant in addition to the market
    and fundamental data that used to be the focus of the analytical efforts.

- en: You may have also come across the insight that the successful application of
    ML or data science requires the integration of statistical knowledge, computational
    skills, and domain expertise at the individual or team level. In other words,
    it is essential to ask the right questions, identify and understand the data that
    may provide the answers, deploy a broad range of tools to obtain results, and
    interpret them in a way that leads to the right decisions.

    that submit small exploratory orders to detect hidden liquidity from large institutional
    investors and trade ahead of a large order to benefit from subsequent price movements.

    (1981) and Reinganum (1981). The value effect (Basu 1982) states that firms with
    low valuation metrics outperform. It suggests that firms with low price multiples,
    such as the price-to-earnings or the price-to-book ratios, perform better than
    their more expensive peers (as suggested by the inventors of value investing,
    Benjamin Graham and David Dodd, and popularized by Warren Buffet).

    momentum stocks with similar market risk. Researchers also found that value and

    the market portfolio. In 1976, Stephen Ross proposed arbitrage pricing theory,
    which asserted that investors are compensated for multiple systematic sources
    of risk that cannot be diversified away. The three most important macro factors
    are growth, inflation, and volatility, in addition to productivity, demographic,
    and political risk. In 1992, Eugene Fama and Kenneth French combined the equity
    risk factors' size and value with a market factor into a single model that better
    explained cross-sectional stock returns. They later added a model that also included
    bond risk factors to simultaneously explain returns for both asset classes.

    Value and momentum risk factors, for instance, are negatively correlated, reducing
    the risk and increasing risk-adjusted returns above and beyond the benefit implied
    by the risk factors. Furthermore, using leverage and long-short strategies, factor
    strategies can be combined into market-neutral approaches. The combination of
    long positions in securities exposed to positive risks with underweight or short
    positions in the securities exposed to negative risks allows for the collection
    of dynamic risk premiums.

    of individual variables. We use a novel game-theoretic approach called **SHapley
    Additive exPlanations** (**SHAP**) to attribute predictive performance to individual
    features in complex Gradient Boosting machines with a large number of input variables.

    fundamentals, price movements or market conditions. A strategy can leverage multiple
    ML algorithms that build on each other. Downstream models can generate signals
    at the portfolio level by integrating predictions about the prospects of individual
    assets, capital market expectations, and the correlation among securities. Alternatively,
    ML predictions can inform discretionary trades as in the quantamental approach
    outlined above. ML predictions can also target specific risk factors, such as
    value or volatility, or implement technical approaches, such as trend following
    or mean reversion:'

    a hierarchical form of risk parity. As a result, risk characteristics are driven
    by patterns in asset prices rather than by asset classes and achieve superior
    risk-return characteristics.

    become a key ingredient for the design and combination of alpha factors, which
    in turn are the key drivers of portfolio performance. We covered various industry
    trends around algorithmic trading strategies, the emergence of alternative data,
    and the use of ML to exploit these new sources of informational advantages.

    data sources—using ML.
