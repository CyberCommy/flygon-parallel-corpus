- en: With the increase in the adoption of Docker containers, the need to monitor
    which containers are running, what resources they are consuming, and how it affects
    the overall performance of the system, has become a time-related need. *Monitoring
    Docker* will teach you how monitoring containers and keeping a keen eye on the
    working of applications help to improve the overall performance of the applications
    that run on Docker.

- en: This book will cover monitoring containers using Docker's native monitoring
    functions, various plugins, and also third-party tools that help in monitoring.
    The book will first cover how to obtain detailed stats for the active containers,
    resources consumed, and container behavior. This book will also show the readers
    how to use these stats to improve the overall performance of the system.

    "Chapter 1. Introduction to Docker Monitoring"), *Introduction to Docker Monitoring*,
    discusses how different it is to monitor containers compared to more traditional
    servers such as virtual machines, bare metal machines, and cloud instances (Pets
    versus Cattle and Chickens versus Snowflakes). This chapter also details the operating
    systems covered in the examples later in this book and also gives a little information
    on how to get a local test environment up and running using vagrant, so that installation
    instructions and practical examples can be easily followed.'

    "Chapter 2. Using the Built-in Tools"), *Using the Built-in Tools*, helps you
    learn about the basic metrics you can get out of the vanilla Docker installation
    and how you can use them. Also, we will understand how to get real-time statistics
    on our running containers, how to use commands that are familiar to us, and how
    to get information on the processes that are launched as part of each container.'

    "an open source, system-level exploration tool to capture system state and activity
    from a running Linux instance, then save, filter, and analyze it." In this chapter,
    you will learn how to use Sysdig to both view your containers'' performance metrics
    in real time and also record sessions to query later.'

    and look at which type of monitoring is appropriate for each of them.'

- en: To ensure the experience is as consistent as possible, we will be installing
    vagrant and VirtualBox to run the virtual machine that will act as a host to run
    our containers. Vagrant is available for Linux, OS X, and Windows; for details
    on how to install this, see the vagrant website at [https://www.vagrantup.com/](https://www.vagrantup.com/).
    The details of how to download and install VirtualBox can be found at [https://www.virtualbox.org/](https://www.virtualbox.org/);
    again, VirtualBox can be installed on Linux, OS X, and Windows.
