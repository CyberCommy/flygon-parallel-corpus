- en: '**Object-oriented programming** (**OOP**) is a programming paradigm organized
    around objects rather than actions, and data rather than logic. With the newest
    release of C#, there are a number of new additions that improve OOP. This book
    aims to teach OOP in C# in an engaging and interactive way. After going through
    the book, you will have an understanding of the four pillars of OOP, which are
    encapsulation, inheritance, abstraction, and polymorphism, and be able to leverage
    the latest features of C# 8.0, such as Nullable Reference Types and Asynchronous
    Streams. You will then explore various design patterns, principles, and best practices
    in OOP.'
