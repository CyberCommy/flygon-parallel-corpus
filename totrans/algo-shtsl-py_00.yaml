- en: 'Market participants always want industries to become more efficient: "cut the
    middle man," "cost-reduction," "rationalization."  We are finally getting a taste
    of our own medicine. Markets average long-term returns of 8% per annum. Yet, roughly
    60% of professional fund managers underperform their benchmark, year in year out.
    90% of retail investors blow up. The way we trade has clearly not been working.
    Despite all the bravado, the emperors of money have been parading naked. We collectively
    need to evolve if we want to survive this market Darwinism. Evolution does not
    take prisoners.'

- en: Global warming is a reality in the financial services. The glacier of actively
    managed money is melting. Mutual funds face intense pressure from exchange traded
    funds to lower fees. Fortunately, there has been a solution right under our noses
    all along, a *terra incognita* where mankind has never set foot.

- en: If we were to stack all books about investing, trading, markets, on top of each
    other, trips to the moon would be a sad ecological reality. Yet, if we were to
    line up books about short selling side by side on a dinner table, there would
    still be enough room for a bottle of Côte-Rôtie, a divine northern Rhône valley
    Shiraz-Viognier wine, and a few glasses. Short selling is the key to raising and
    maintaining assets under management. When the markets tank, those who still stand
    up, stand out. Money may temporarily flow (and ebb) to those who shine in bull
    markets, but it will always gravitate towards those who perform in down markets.
    Investors may forget unimpressive returns, yet they will not forgive drawdowns.

- en: Short selling commands premium fees. Suppose you add a short book to your endangered
    long-only mutual fund. From that day on, you can command premium management fees
    and even demand steep performance fees. You will enjoy more freedom in your mandate
    to trade exotic instruments, freedom to keep a higher cash balance, freedom to
    selectively disclose your positions. And the price of freedom is to learn to sell
    short.

- en: This book is written by a practitioner for practitioners. It is for advanced
    to expert market participants. Even if you have never coded a line in Python,
    this book is still for you. It was originally written without the source code.
    This later addition is meant to help readers implement the concepts in real life.
    If you are an experienced coder but new to the markets, you will pick up concepts
    that will help you on your journey. You may however want to supplement your market
    education with further reading.

- en: Even if you choose never to sell short, this book is still for you. The tools
    and techniques developed for the short side are built to withstand extreme conditions. If
    you can survive the arid environment of the short side, imagine how you will thrive
    on the long side. If you are in the long/short business, the question is not whether
    you should read this book or not. The real question is can you afford to *not*
    read this book. You may disagree with some ideas, but they will provoke thoughts
    and spark conversation. The ideas we originally resist are the ones that makes
    us grow, so welcome to the space beyond your comfort zone.
