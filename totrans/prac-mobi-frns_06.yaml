- en: A key aspect of iOS-device forensics is to examine and analyze the data acquired
    to interpret the evidence. In the previous chapters, you learned various techniques
    to acquire data from iOS devices. Any type of acquired image contains hundreds
    of data files that are often parsed by the tools described in earlier chapters.
    Even when the data is parsed by the forensic tool, a manual analysis may be required
    to uncover additional artifacts or to simply validate your findings.

    formats that are used on iOS devices. Timestamps found on iOS devices are presented
    either in the *Unix timestamp* or *Mac absolute* *time* format. You, as the examiner,
    must ensure that the tools properly convert the timestamps. Access to the raw
    SQLite files will allow you to verify these timestamps manually. You'll learn
    how to decode each timestamp format in the next few sections.

- en: Third-party applications that are downloaded and installed from the App Store—including
    applications such as Facebook, WhatsApp, Viber, Threema, Tango, Skype, and Gmail—contain
    a wealth of information that is useful for an investigation. Some third-party
    applications use Base64 encoding, which needs to be converted for viewing purposes
    as well as encryption. Applications that encrypt the database file may prevent
    you from accessing the data residing in the tables. Encryption varies among these
    applications, based on the application and iOS versions.

    for each application that is installed on the device in the `/private/var/mobile/Containers/Data/Application` directory.
    Most of the files stored in the application's directory are in the SQLite and
    `plist` format. Each file must be examined for relevance. We recommend using Belkasoft
    Evidence Center, Cellebrite UFED Physical Analyzer, Elcomsoft Phone Viewer, and
    Magnet AXIOM when possible to extract these artifacts quickly, before going back
    and manually running queries and parsing the data.

- en: SQLite databases store the deleted records within the database itself, so it
    is possible to recover deleted data, such as contacts, SMS messages, calendars,
    notes, email, voicemail, and more by parsing the corresponding SQLite database.
    If an SQLite database is vacuumed or defragmented, the likelihood of recovering
    the deleted data is minimal. The amount of cleanup that these databases require
    relies heavily on the iOS version, the device, and the user's settings on the
    device.

- en: A SQLite database file comprises one or more fixed-size pages, which are used
    just once. SQLite uses a B-tree layout of pages to store indices and table content.
    Detailed information on the B-tree layout can be found at [https://github.com/NotionalLabs/SQLiteZer/blob/master/_resources/Sqlite_carving_extractAndroidData.pdf](https://github.com/NotionalLabs/SQLiteZer/blob/master/_resources/Sqlite_carving_extractAndroidData.pdf).

- en: Commercial forensic tools provide support to recover deleted data from SQLite
    database files, but they don't always recover all of the data, nor do they support
    extracting data from all databases on an iOS device. It is recommended that each
    database containing key artifacts be examined for deleted data. The key artifacts
    or databases already discussed in this book should be examined using free parsers,
    hex viewers, or even your forensic tool to determine whether the user deleted
    artifacts that are relevant to the investigation.

    for common artifacts within the iOS device's filesystem. When writing this chapter,
    we aimed to cover the most popular artifacts that tie into most investigations.
    Clearly, it is impossible to cover them all. We hope that once you learn how to
    extract data from SQLite and `plist` files, intuition and persistence will assist
    you in parsing the artifacts that were not covered.

    and deleted data from common database files, such as contacts, calls, SMS messages,
    and more, but they often overlook the third-party application database files.
    Our best advice is to know how to recover the data manually, just in case you
    need to validate your findings or testify as to how your tool functions.
