- en: Productivity is an important factor for a software developer. A good development
    environment or surrounding tools with the essence of a particular programming
    flavor can boost up our coding productivity and yield a quality and optimized
    software product. In order to maintain a fast-paced development, developers seek
    the environment with which they feel at home. Such an Integrated Development Environment
    (IDE) can really accelerate code implementation and be the magic wand to your
    project development.
