- en: Node-RED is a flow-based programming tool that was made by Node.js. This tool
    is mainly used for connecting IoT devices and software applications. However,
    it can cover not only IoT but also standard web applications.

- en: This book is best for those who are learning about software programming for
    the first time with no-code/low-code programming tools. Node-RED is a flow-based
    programming tool, and this tool can build web applications for any software applications
    easily, such as IoT data handling, standard web applications, web APIs, and so
    on. So, this book will help web application developers and IoT engineers.

- en: '[*Chapter 1*](B16353_01_ePub_AM.xhtml#_idTextAnchor015), *Introducing Node-RED
    and Flow-Based Programming*, teaches us what Node-RED is. The content also touches
    on flow-based programming, explaining why Node-RED was developed and what it is
    used for. Understanding this new tool, Node-RED, is helpful to improve our programming
    experience.'

    Environment*, covers setting up the development environment by installing Node-RED.
    Node-RED can be installed for any OS Node.js can run, such as Windows, macOS,
    Rasberry Pi OS, and so on. We install Node-RED on each environment with the command
    line or using the installer. This chapter covers important notes for specific
    OSes.'

    Characteristics by Creating Basic Flows*, teaches us about the basic usage of
    Node-RED. In Node-RED, various functions are used with parts called nodes. In
    Node-RED, we create an application with a concept called a flow, like a workflow.
    We will create a sample flow by combining basic nodes.'

    Nodes*, teaches us how to utilize more nodes. We will not only learn about the
    nodes provided by Node-RED by default but also how to acquire various nodes published
    on the internet by the community and how to use them.'

    Locally*, teaches us best practices for leveraging Node-RED in our local environment,
    our desktop environment. Since Node-RED is a tool based on Node.js, it is good
    at building server-side applications. However, servers aren''t just on beyond
    the network. It is possible to use it more conveniently by using Node-RED in a
    virtual runtime on the local environment of an edge device such as Raspberry Pi.'

    in the Cloud*, teaches us best practices for leveraging Node-RED on a cloud platform.
    Since Node-RED is a tool based on Node.js, it is good at building server-side
    applications. It is possible to use it more conveniently by using Node-RED on
    any cloud platform, so we will make flows with Node-RED on IBM Cloud as one of
    the use cases with cloud platforms.'

    from Node-RED*, teaches us how to utilize the web API from Node-RED. In order
    to maximize the appeal of web applications, it is essential to link with various
    web APIs. Its application development architecture is no exception in Node-RED.
    Understanding the difference between calling a web API from a regular Node.js
    application and calling it from Node-RED can help us get the most out of Node-RED.'

    Feature with Git*, teaches us how to use source code version control tools in
    Node-RED. With Node-RED, the project function is available in version 1.x and
    later. The project function can be linked with each source code version control
    tool based on Git. By versioning the flows with the repository, our development
    will be accelerated.'

    The web application here is a simple ToDo application. The architecture of the
    entire application is very simple and will help us understand how to develop a
    web application, including the user interface, using Node-RED.'

    Data on the Raspberry Pi*, teaches us application development methods for IoT
    data processing using Node-RED. Node-RED was originally developed to handle IoT
    data. Therefore, many of the use cases where Node-RED is still used today are
    IoT data processing. Node-RED passes the data acquired from sensors for each process
    we want to do and publishes it.'

    development methods for IoT data processing using Node-RED on the cloud platform
    side. We usually use the data from edge devices on any cloud platform for analyzing,
    visualization, and so on. Node-RED handles the data subscribed from the MQTT broker
    and visualizes it for any purpose.'

    Application Using Slack and IBM Watson*, teaches us how to create a chatbot application.
    At first glance, Node-RED and chatbots don''t seem to be related, but many chatbot
    applications use Node-RED behind the scenes. The reason is that Node-RED can perform
    server-side processing on a data-by-data basis like a workflow. Here, we create
    a chatbot that runs on Slack, which is used worldwide.'

    Your Own Node on the Node-RED Library*, teaches us how to develop nodes ourselves.
    For many use cases, we can find the node for the processing we need from the Node-RED
    Library. This is because many nodes are exposed on the internet thanks to the
    contributions of many developers. Let''s aid a large number of other Node-RED
    users by developing our own node and publishing it to the Node-RED Library.'

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You will need Node-RED version 1.2 or later, Node.js version 12 or later, npm
    version 6 or later, and preferably the latest minor version installed on your
    computer. But this is the case when running Node-RED in a local environment. In
    the case of running on IBM Cloud, which is one of the tutorials in this book,
    it depends on the environment of the cloud platform. All code examples have been
    tested on macOS, Windows, and Raspberry Pi OS, but some chapters have command-line
    instructions based on macOS.
