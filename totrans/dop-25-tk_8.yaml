- en: We explored quite a few topics that are beyond "normal" Kubernetes usage. We
    learned how to scale Pods using HorizontalPodAutoscaler. We saw that scaling Pods
    does not provide enough benefits if we cannot scale cluster nodes as well. We
    explored how to do just that using Cluster Autoscaler. Unfortunately, it is currently
    available only for AWS, GKE, and AKS.

- en: While scaling Pods and nodes is essential, we had to gather metrics as well.
    They give us insights into the behavior of our clusters and applications running
    inside it. For that, we adopted Prometheus. More importantly, we saw how we can
    leverage Alertmanager to create notifications that will alert us when there is
    an issue, instead of staring at a screen waiting for a graph to reach a "red line".

- en: We learned that gathering metrics from exporters might not be enough, so we
    instrumented our applications as a way of providing lower level metrics that give
    us deep insights into the state of our applications.

- en: We also explored HorizontalPodAutoscaler's ability to use custom metrics. We
    hooked it into Prometheus thus extending scaling thresholds to almost any formula
    we could imagine.

- en: Given that we collect metrics in Prometheus and that it doesn't provide dashboarding
    functionality, we connected it to Grafana. During the process, we explored ways
    that dashboards can be made more useful than traditional "pretty colors" many
    are instinctively drawn to.

- en: Finally, we discussed the need for centralized logging as well as a few tools
    that might help us debug issues discovered through alerts. For that, we evaluated
    Papertrail, AWS CloudWatch, GCP Stackdriver, Azure Log Analytics, and the Elasticsearch-Fluentd-Kibana
    (EFK) stack.

- en: We went beyond common Kubernetes operations and managed to make our clusters
    more robust and more reliable. We made a step forward towards mostly autonomous
    self-adaptive systems that require human intervention only in exceptional cases
    that cannot be resolved automatically. When we do need to intervene, we'll do
    that equipped with all the necessary information required to quickly deduce the
    cause of the issue and perform corrective actions that will restore our cluster
    to the desired state.

- en: Like the previous books, this one was also a collaboration effort. Many helped
    shape this book through discussions, notes, and bug reports. I was swarmed with
    comments through *DevOps20* ([http://slack.devops20toolkit.com/](http://slack.devops20toolkit.com/)) Slack
    (often private) messages and emails. The conversations I had with the readers
    of the early editions of the book influenced the end result significantly. I'm
    grateful to have such a great community behind me. **Thank you for helping me
    make this book great.**
