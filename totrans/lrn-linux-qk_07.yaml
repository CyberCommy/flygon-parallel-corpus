    preserves the current user shell environment settings, which includes the current
    working directory. On the other hand, when you add the dash, the shell acquires
    the environment settings of the new user (the user you switched to).

    section by itself. Also, remember that you have got superpowers when you are the
    `root` user as you have the permission to do anything on your system. And so if
    you are not very careful, you can damage your system, and that's why there is
    a very famous Linux meme that says, "Don't drink and root!."
