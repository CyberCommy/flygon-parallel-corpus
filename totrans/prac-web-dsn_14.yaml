    here* over and over again?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Lorem Ipsum isn't just a filler text, it also provides an illusion. In content,
    just like what you're reading here, there is variation. You'll have two-letter
    words next to nine-letter words. There is no repeating pattern.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, when you use a repeated phrase as your text placeholder, it can taint
    the entire project. The human eye will get distracted by the repeating pattern.
    This, of course, will pull attention away from your overall design and potentially
    cause the client to focus on all the nitpicky things that look off about the project.

    is that you can gain more time during your projects.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    with an `@` sign. Then, you can store a constant value that you can then reuse
    throughout your stylesheet. It's definitely a tool worth checking out.

    one of them. Also, similar to LESS, SASS is open source and supported by a huge
    community of developers. Likewise, it's also backward compatible so that you can
    convert your CSS files.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So, why go with SASS over LESS? Depending on who you ask, SASS is much more
    popular and LESS is easier to use. It may boil down to whether you prefer Ruby
    or JavaScript. SASS is written in Ruby. However, LESS, which was originally written
    in Ruby, has ported to JavaScript. You'll need NodeJS to run LESS.
