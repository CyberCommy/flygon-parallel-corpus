- en: The principles of asynchronous event-driven programming are perfect for today's
    Web, where efficient real-time applications and scalability are at the forefront.
    Server-side JavaScript has been here since the nineties, but Node got it right.
    With a thriving community and interest from the Internet giants, it could be the
    PHP of tomorrow.

    are designed to smoothly progress you to making full web applications, command-line
    applications, and Node modules. *Node Cookbook* takes you through interfacing
    with various database backends, such as MySQL, MongoDB, and Redis, working with
    web sockets, and interfacing with network protocols, such as SMTP. Additionally,
    there are recipes on handling streams of data, security implementations, writing,
    your own Node modules, and different ways to take your apps live.
