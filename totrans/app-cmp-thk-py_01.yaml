    throughout our day. When we search for something online, when we use our smartphone,
    when we use our fitness trackers or smartwatches, and so much more, there are
    algorithms involved. Even our cars have computers that we interact with, some
    of us daily. We're going to look at what is behind programming and designing algorithms,
    starting with some of the basic fundamentals of computer science, looking at some
    applications of computational thinking and algorithm designs with the Python programming
    language.

    elements of computational thinking – namely, decomposition, pattern recognition,
    pattern generalization, and abstraction – and algorithm design.
