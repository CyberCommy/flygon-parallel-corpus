- en: Microservices are the next big thing in designing scalable, easy-to-maintain
    applications. They not only makes application development easier, but also offer
    great flexibility to utilize various resources optimally. If you want to build
    an enterprise-ready implementation of a microservice architecture, then this is
    the book for you!

- en: Starting off by understanding the core concepts and framework, you will then
    focus on the high-level design of large software projects. You will gradually
    move on to setting up the development environment and configuring it before implementing
    continuous integration to deploy your microservice architecture. Using Spring
    Security, you will secure microservices and test them effectively using REST Java
    clients and other tools such as RxJava 2.0\. We'll show you the best patterns,
    practices, and common principles of microservice design, and you'll learn to troubleshoot
    and debug the issues faced during development. We'll show you how to design and
    implement reactive microservices. Finally, we'll show you how to migrate a monolithic
    application to a microservice-based application.
