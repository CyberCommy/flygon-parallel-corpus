- en: Three-dimensional models are everywhere, from mechanical engineering of machine
    parts to medical imaging; from video game design to 3D printing. 3D models are
    as prolific as photos, videos, music, and other media. Yet, while browsers and
    apps have native support for other media types, 3D models do not have so much.
    One day 3D viewing standards will be integrated into the browser (such as WebGL
    and WebVR). Until then, we'll have to rely on plugins and sister apps to view
    our models. Free 3D file models in the OBJ format, for example, can be found online,
    including TF3DM ([http://tf3dm.com/](http://tf3dm.com/)), TurboSquid ([http://www.turbosquid.com/](http://www.turbosquid.com/)),
    and many others ([http://www.hongkiat.com/blog/60-excellent-free-3d-model-websites/](http://www.hongkiat.com/blog/60-excellent-free-3d-model-websites/)).

- en: In this project, we will build an Android 3D model viewer app that lets you
    open and view models in 3D using a Cardboard VR headset. The file format that
    we'll use is OBJ, an open format first developed by Wavefront Technologies for
    cinematic 3D animation. OBJs can be created and exported by many 3D design applications,
    including open source ones, such as Blender and MeshLab, as well as commercial
    ones, such as 3D Studio Max and Maya. An OBJ is a noncompressed plain text file
    that stores a description of the surface mesh of a 3D object composed of triangles
    (or higher degree polygons).

    Sets of vertices are connected to define a face of the mesh surface. A full mesh
    surface is a collection of these faces.

    The normal vector defines the outward facing direction at that vertex, used in

    onto the mesh surface. There are other features of the format, including free-form
    curves and materials, which we will not support in this project.

    in the scene to look around in unison with your head movement. In this project,
    the head movement will be like an input control rotating the model. The model

    rotational orientation). We will also conjugate (that is, invert or reverse) the
    rotation, so that when you look up, you see the bottom of the object and so on.

    it from within the inner class. You may have also noticed that we added a call
    to the material's `setup` program before starting the thread to ensure that it's
    properly set up in time and avoid crashing the app. This avoids the need to call
    `createMaterial` within a `queueEvent` procedure, since the shader compiler makes
    use of the graphics context. Similarly, we disable the object until it has completed
    loading its data. Finally, since the load is asynchronous, it's necessary to set
    the scale at the end of this procedure. Our previous method set the scale in `setup()`,
    which now completes before the model is done loading.

    declares its intent to use another app for a certain purpose. The intent object
    contains a number of members to describe what type of action needs to be done,
    and, if any, the data on which it needs to be done. For the image gallery, we
    associated the intent filter with an image mime type. For this project, we'll
    associate an intent filter with a filename extension.

    all) at this point. Then again, it might be sufficient, depending on the requirements
    of your own projects, for example, if you include specific models in the resource
    folder that can be viewed in the released version of your app. When you have complete
    control of the input data, you can cut corners.

    format. We implemented a `ModelObject` class that parses the model file and builds
    the vector and normal buffers needed by `RenderBox` to render the object in the
    scene. We then enabled shading. We then made the viewer interactive so that the
    model rotates as you move your head.
