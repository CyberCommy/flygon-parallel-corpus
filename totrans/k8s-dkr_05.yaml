- en: In this second section, we will move onto Kubernetes clusters and objects. The
    first chapter in this section will explain how to use a popular tool for creating
    Kubernetes clusters, called KinD. We will explain how to create differnet clusters
    that range from a single-node cluster to a multiple-node cluster that uses HAProxy
    as a load balancer for the worker nodes. With a working Kubernetes cluster, we
    move onto the next chapter, which will review the Kubernetes infrastructure components
    and the most commonly used Kubernetes objects. We close out this section by explaining
    a commonly misunderstood topic, exposing services in a cluster. We will look at
    Kubernetes service types, discuss how to use Layer 7 and Layer 4 load balancers,
    and see how to register dynamic names for services using External-DNS.
