- en: Test-driven development has been around for a while and many people have still
    not adopted it. The reason behind this is that TDD is difficult to master. Even
    though the theory is very easy to grasp, it takes a lot of practice to become
    really proficient with it. The authors of this book have been practicing TDD for
    years and will try to pass on their experience to you. They are developers and
    believe that the best way to learn some coding practice is through code and constant
    practice. This book follows the same philosophy. We'll explain all the TDD concepts
    through exercises. This will be a journey through TDD best practices applied to
    Java development. At the end of it, you will earn a TDD black belt and have one
    more tool in your software craftsmanship tool belt.
