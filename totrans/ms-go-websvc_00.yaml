    it's that "*Go is a server language*."

- en: Certainly, Go was built to be an ideal server language, designed as a next-generation
    iteration over the expanses and/or over-engineering of C, C++, and Java.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The language has evolved—largely with fervent community support—to go far beyond
    servers into system tools, graphics, and even compilers for new languages. At
    its heart, however, Go is made for powerful, concurrent, and easy-to-deploy cross-platform
    servers. This is what makes the language ideal for this book's topic.

    connecting Go to other services and keeping your server secure and highly available.

    way to do this is through a binary, available for OS X or Windows at [URL]. Go
    is also readily available via multiple Linux package managers, such as yum or

    Text, which has fantastic Go support, among other languages. We'll spend a bit
    more time detailing some of the pros and cons of the other common IDEs in [Chapter

    MongoDB, Nginx, and more. Most should be available across platforms, but if you're
    running Windows, it's recommended that you consider running a Linux platform—preferably
    an Ubuntu server—on a virtual machine to ensure maximum compatibility.

    development for web services and APIs. We haven't spent any time on the basics
    of programming in Go, so if you're shaky on that aspect, it's recommended that
    you brush up on it prior to diving in.

    some familiarity with REST as a guiding principle for API design, and is at least
    aware of Go's native server capabilities.

    but fundamental understanding of Go's core library is essential, and general understanding
    of networked server architecture setup and maintenance is ideal.
