- en: Android is probably the buzzword of this decade. In a short span, it has taken
    over the majority of the handset market. Android is staged to take over wearables,
    our TV rooms, as well as our cars this autumn with the Android L release. With
    the frantic pace at which Android is growing, a developer needs to up his or her
    skill sets as well. Database-oriented application development is one of the key
    skills every developer should have. SQLite database in applications is the heart
    of a data-centric product and key to building great products. Understanding SQLite
    and implementing the Android database can be a steep learning curve for some people.
    Concepts such as content providers and loaders are more complex to understand
    and implement. *Android SQLite Essentials* equips developers with tools to build
    database-based Android applications in a simplistic manner. It is written keeping
    in mind the current needs and best practices being followed in the industry. Let
    us start our journey.

    Ubuntu, or Mac OS preinstalled. Download and set up the Java environment; we require
    this for the IDE of our choice, Eclipse, to run. Download Android SDK from the
    Android developer's site and Android ADT plugin for Eclipse. Alternatively, you
    can download the Eclipse ADT bundle that contains Eclipse SDK and the ADT plugin.
    You can also try Android Studio; this IDE, which just moved to beta, is also available
    on the developer site. Make sure your operating system, JDK, and IDE are all of
    either 32 bit or 64 bit.
