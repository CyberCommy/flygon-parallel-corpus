- en: This section will introduce you to cross-platform development. The idea of cross-platform
    development is that a software application should work well on more than one platform
    without significant code change. This saves time in porting and maintaining the
    code base. This follows the Qt philosophy of "code less, create more, and deploy
    everywhere." In this section, you will learn about the Qt Creator IDE, its usage,
    and how you can develop and run the same application on different platforms.
