- en: Businesses today are evolving so rapidly that they are resorting the elasticity
    of the cloud to provide a platform to build and deploy their highly scalable applications.
    This means that developers now are faced with the challenge of building build
    applications that are native to the cloud. For this, they need to be aware of
    the environment, tools, and resources they're coding against.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The book begins by explaining the driving factors for cloud adoption and shows
    you how cloud deployment is different from regular application deployment on a
    standard data centre. You will learn about design patterns specific to applications
    running in the cloud and find out how you can build a microservice in Java Spring
    using REST APIs.

- en: You will then take a deep dive into the life cycle of building, testing, and
    deploying applications with maximum automation to reduce the deployment cycle
    time. Gradually, you will move on to configuring the AWS and Azure platforms and
    working with their APIs to deploy your application. Finally, you'll take a look
    at API design concerns and their best practices. You'll also learn how to migrate
    an existing monolithic application into distributed cloud-native applications.

    and robust cloud-native application that is always available and fault tolerant.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Java developers who want to build resilient, robust, and scalable applications
    that are targeted for cloud-based deployment will find this book helpful. Some
    knowledge of Java, Spring, web programming, and public cloud providers (AWS and
    Azure) should be sufficient to get you through the book.

- en: The book starts with an introduction and then builds on a simple service, step
    by step, through the chapters. Hence, the readers will benefit by following the
    flow of the book, unless they are looking for a particular topic.

    more as you type the code out, especially in the initial chapters. The book is
    written in such a way that the important concepts and code are present in the
    chapter, thus preventing you from going back to see the source code.

    concrete and easier to grasp.

    be running containers and VMs on your machine, which take resources, it is good
    to have a strong piece of equipment to get going.

- en: The cloud is a technology that changes very rapidly. Hence, this book stresses
    on concepts and demonstrates them through code. For example, CQRS is important as
    a concept, so we have shown implementation on MongoDB and Elasticsearch. However,
    you can try out the pattern on any other set of databases.
