    as how many resources are provided for a school district, how large the budget
    for a county or state's Medicare program will be, how much we pay for housing
    in an area, and the trends of the real estate market. Data is embedded in the
    way that we interact with advertisements too. Simply put, understanding more about
    data and how to use Python to analyze this data is a really important skillset.

    programming language associated with data analysis and other applications, such
    as cryptography, experimental data, data mining, and machine learning. We will
    use computational thinking to design solutions and algorithms for many real-world,
    applied problems, from those in language and historical analysis to some machine
    learning applications.
