- en: This second edition of *Mastering Python for Finance* will guide you through
    carrying out complex financial calculations practiced in the finance industry,
    using next-generation methodologies. You will master the Python ecosystem by leveraging
    publicly available tools to successfully perform research studies and modeling,
    and learn how to manage risks using advanced examples.

- en: You will start by setting up a Jupyter notebook to implement the tasks throughout
    the book. You will learn how to make efficient and powerful data-driven financial
    decisions using popular libraries such as TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, SciPy, scikit-learn,
    and so on. You will also learn how to build financial applications by mastering
    concepts such as stocks, options, interest rates and their derivatives, and risk
    analytics using computational methods. With these foundations, you will learn
    how to apply statistical analysis on time series data and understand how to harness
    high-frequency data to devise trading strategies in building an algorithmic trading
    platform. You will learn to validate your trading strategies by implementing an
    event-driven backtesting system and measure its performance. Finally, you will
    explore machine learning and deep learning techniques that are applied in finance.
