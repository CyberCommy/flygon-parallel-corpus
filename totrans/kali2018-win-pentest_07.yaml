    Social Engineering Toolkit and Metasploit to exploit Windows vulnerabilities.
    You will also learn to use the exploit databases provided with Kali Linux, and
    others. You will learn to use tools to exploit several common Windows vulnerabilities,
    and guidelines to create and implement new exploits for upcoming Windows vulnerabilities.

    is hacker speak for **own**. If you have been pwned, your systems have been **owned**.
    In other words, I own your system now I am in full control of it. Exploitation
    is the process of owning or compromising the machine. So far, we have gathered
    information on our target by gathering public information on the target and scanned
    the target network for vulnerabilities. We are now ready for the attack.

    and quietly as possible. They will try to stay under the noise of normal operations.
    Yes, there are more eyes on the network at that time, but as a smart cracker knows,
    if you are slow and quiet, a lot of traffic is a good cover.

- en: If you're the security operations guy and you're testing your own network, this
    is not a good idea. Test during your network during off-hours is best when the
    CEO is asleep. If any accidents happen during the test, things can be fixed and
    working before the next day, when the CEO is awake. Exploitation doesn't normally
    kill a system beyond repair during testing, but some exploits will sometimes hang
    a service, or completely hang the system to the point where it needs a reboot.
    The entire purpose of some exploits is to perform **Denial of Service** (**DoS**)
    to a service, or a system. Bo doesn't see these as true exploits. Yes, you have
    attacked the system, and taken it offline; but you haven't penetrated the machine.
    You have made a successful attack but you don't pwn it. The real bad guys don't
    use DoS attacks. They want to get in, and steal or copy data from all over your
    network. Services going down draws the attention of IT. Not a good thing, if you
    are trying to break in. DoS attacks are script kiddie stuff; if this is all you
    know, don't call yourself a hacker.
  id: totrans-9

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: DoS tools are considered exploits also because they work on the system in the
    same method. A DoS hangs a system. An exploit to gain access often hangs a system
    long enough for you to inject some type of code to gain access. Basically, you
    make the machine go stupid for long enough to establish a connection. When your
    exploit tool fails, it may just look like a DoS attack. If you have a choice,
    it is better to have the failed exploit look like a temporary denial of service,
    which can be misinterpreted as an innocent NIC failure at an origin host, than
    as a cracker testing exploit code on the target system.

    of a system when you are testing them. Always have contact information for people
    to call *when things go wrong*, before you start testing. Although you may try
    to be quiet, and not knock anything off-line, have your *Plan B* in place. Also,
    always have your *Get out of Jail* card before testing!

    brings just about every tool you'll ever need as a plugin or function within the
    framework. It doesn't matter what OS or even what kind of device you discover
    on the network you are testing, Metasploit is likely will have a module to exploit
    it. Bo does 90% of his work with Metasploit.
  id: totrans-25
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Metasploit comes in two versions—the Community version and the Professional
    version. At the command line they are both the same. The major thing you get with
    the Professional version is a nice web interface and reporting tools that will
    build reports for you from that interface. You also get some good tools for testing
    large networks that aren't available from the command line. One feature is that
    you can pick a machine or several machines from the imported vulnerability scan
    and the Pro version will automatically pick out modules and run these against
    the target machines. If you working on large networks, or doing a lot of testing,
    get the Professional version. It is well worth the money, and you can easily use
    it on your Kali attack platform.

    some of the Community libraries in order to run.

    for you. For `show options`, type `sh<tab> o<tab>`. You will see this will auto-complete
    the commands. This works throughout Metsploit.

    and attacking the same machine, arrowing up to the previous commands does save
    time.

    any login credentials that are collected and any system data collected during

    results of a previous test later. We're going to set up a project called `TestCompany-int-20180830`.
    This is a way to name projects, with `<client-name>-[ int (internal) | ext (external)

    leaks. From the scans, we can see a Windows Domain Controller and a Windows File
