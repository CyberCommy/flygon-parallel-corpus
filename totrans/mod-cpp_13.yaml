    part of it is an 8-bit value, ranging from 0 to 255\. For easy representation
    and handling, we can use four `unsigned char` to store the address value. Such
    a value could be constructed either from four `unsigned char` or from an `unsigned
    long`. In order to be able to read a value directly from the console (or any other

    arguments (one for the index on each dimension). The latter can only have a single
    argument, and in order to enable expressions like `a[i][j]`, it has to return
    an intermediate type (one that basically represents a row) that in turn overloads
    `operator[]` to return a single element.

    vectors (each row is a `vector<T>` with `C` elements, and the 2D array has `R`

    elements of type `T`. In the latter case, the element on row `i` and column `j`
    is found at index `i * C + j`. This approach has a smaller memory footprint, stores
    all data in a single contiguous chunk, and is also simpler to implement. For these
    reasons, it is the preferred solution.

    or failure. Since all these functions, which we could call `contains_all`, `contains_any`,
    and `contains_none`, do is apply logical operators on the results returned by
    the helper function, we would use fold expressions to simplify the code. Short
    circuit evaluation is enabled after the expansion of the fold expression, which
    means we are evaluating only the elements that lead to a definitive result. So
    if we are looking for the presence of all 1, 2, and 3, and 2 is missing, the function

    In the following snippet, specific to Windows, you can see a function where a
    file is opened, read from, and eventually closed. However, this has a couple of
    problems: in one case, the developer forgot to close the handle before leaving
    the function; in another case, a function that throws is called before the handle
    is properly closed, without the exception being caught. However, since the function
