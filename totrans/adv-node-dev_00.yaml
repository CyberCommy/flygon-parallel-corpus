- en: Welcome to *Advanced Node.js Development*. This book is packed with a ton of
    content, projects, challenges, and real-world examples, all designed to teach
    you Node by *doing*. This means you'll be getting your hands dirty early on in
    the upcoming chapters writing some code, and you'll be writing code for every
    project. You will be writing every line of code that powers our applications.
    Now, we would require a text editor for this book.

- en: All the projects in the book are fun to build and they were designed to teach
    you everything required to launch your own Node app, from planning to development
    and testing to deploying. Now, as you launch these different Node applications
    and move through the book, you will run into errors, which is bound to happen.
    Maybe something doesn't get installed as expected, or maybe you try to run an
    app and instead of getting the expected output, you get a really long obscure
    error message. Don't worry, I am there to help. I'll show you tips and tricks
    to get pass through those errors in the chapters. Let's go ahead and get to it.
