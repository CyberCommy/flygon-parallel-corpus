    but sometimes the results are not as expected. Common problems related to parallel/asynchronous
    code are performance and correctness.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With performance, we mean that the results of execution are slow. With correctness,
    we mean that results are not as expected (this might be due to race conditions).
    Another big issue when dealing with multiple concurrent tasks is deadlocks. Debugging
    multithreaded code is always a challenge as threads keep switching while you are
    debugging. While working on GUI-based applications, it's also important to find
    out which thread is running our code.

    issues as well as race conditions. Using the `Threads` window, we can check and
