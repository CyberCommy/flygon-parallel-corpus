- en: Now that we have covered some basic networking and firewalling principles and
    are aware of the features that IPCop allows us to leverage, we can look at how
    to install the firewall. IPCop can be installed in a variety of ways, but using
    a CDROM (sometimes with an accompanying floppy disk) is the simplest and most
    common method. Therefore, we shall look at this installation method with a fairly
    detailed walk-through and in later sections we shall talk about the options we
    have for more advanced installations, such as installing over a network and debugging
    the installation procedure.

    on common PC hardware. Our main issue generally isn't "*is this machine powerful
    enough for IPCop*" it is more a case of "*is this machine powerful enough to handle
    the bandwidth going through it*".

- en: Although as a result of the minimum requirements for IPCop it is very tempting
    to put it on an old workstation or out-of-date PC, it is worth taking a step back
    to consider how we use it. In a home environment or in a very small office, an
    old PC may provide the requisite level of reliability, but it might not if internet
    access is critical, and especially if we use more complex functionality in IPCop
    such as VPNs or complex firewall rules, which are harder to duplicate, the damage
    caused by a hardware failure may be critical, even if we have backups.

- en: A slightly more reliable, newer host therefore may be worth considering. There
    are also considerations based on the environment the firewall will be in. In a
    home or small office environment in which the firewall may not be in a server
    room or comms cupboard, the noise of an older PSU, while minimal, may be annoying.
    The power usage by such a server may also be a consideration—removing some unnecessary
    components or downgrading the PSU to a newer, more efficient, lower wattage model
    may solve the noise and power problems.

- en: Hardware setup is worth considering, too—the location of our server should be
    considered such that rewiring is not an issue and the box will not require relocation
    or be tripped over. As we have mentioned before, we should also enable certain
    settings in the BIOS, such as disabling the 'halt on error' function (so that
    our box does not freeze at a prompt if the keyboard is removed or a component
    is damaged, unless we want this to happen). Another common BIOS option is the
    'resume on power' option—causing our server to automatically turn back on in the
    event of a power outage.

    the CDROM. Since we have a CDROM in the box we can choose the **CDROM** option.
    We will then be prompted by a message that says **Please Insert the IPCop CDROM**
    **in the CDROM drive**. This does not mean that the installation process didn't

    It's generally a good idea to put a smaller disk in IPCop as it won't use a tremendous
    amount of space, depending upon how many log files we anticipate IPCop to have.
    We must ensure to meet the minimum requirements however, which is around 200 MB,
    while anything above 10 GB or so is highly unlikely to be used, unless you end
    up using add-ons that require more space—these add-ons will likely provide you

    for instance, we might have a 10Mbit and a 100Mbit card, and wish to use the 10Mbit
    card for our internet connection. In this instance, we can employ one of two techniques—either
    to select the driver for the specific card we want as the Green interface ourselves,
    or to put the cards into the machine in order such that the Green card is in the
    lowest-numbered PCI or ISA slot. Also note that the name IPCop gives the card
    may not be the name of the make or model of the card as it relates to the **chipset**
    in use, for example many common cards will be identified as **Digital 21x4x Tulip

    of these instances, assistance for the problem in particular can be found via

- en: Grub is one of the commonly used boot loaders for Linux, and it essentially
    intermediates between the computer's BIOS and the operating system, letting us
    choose multiple operating systems or just specify options for one (such as picking
    SMP or ACPI support rather than the standard kernel, as in the menu shown in the
    previous screenshot).

    last for a few seconds, followed by a satisfying set of happy beeps and finally
    the following output:'

    successfully booted the IPCop system. IPCop will now function as a basic NAT firewall
    for us, without the need for further configuration.

  zh: 总结
- en: In this chapter we covered getting an IPCop system up and running with the configurations
    and topologies we covered previously. We also saw that NAT should be passing through
    the firewall; clients should be able to obtain IP addresses, use DNS, and access
    the Internet. We can now go on to customize the system and enable features and
    services that aren't available by default. In the next few chapters we will cover
    basic configuration and then look at more advanced options such as Intrusion Detection
    and VPNs.

  zh: 在本章中，我们介绍了如何使用之前介绍的配置和拓扑来启动和运行IPCop系统。我们还看到NAT应该通过防火墙；客户端应该能够获取IP地址，使用DNS，并访问互联网。现在我们可以继续定制系统，并启用默认情况下不可用的功能和服务。在接下来的几章中，我们将介绍基本配置，然后再看看更高级的选项，比如入侵检测和VPN。
