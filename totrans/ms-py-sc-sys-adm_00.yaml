- en: Python has evolved and extended its features toward every possible IT operation.
    This book will help you leverage the latest features of Python to write effective
    scripts and create command-line tools (for use when it comes to data types, loops,
    conditionals, functions, error handling, and more) to administer your environment.
    This book will revolve around the entire development process, from setup and planning
    to automated testing and building different command-line tools. This book gets you
    up and running with everything from basic scripting to using standard library
    packages. Finally, you will create a large scripting project where you will learn
    how to plan, implement, and distribute a project based on ideal resources.
