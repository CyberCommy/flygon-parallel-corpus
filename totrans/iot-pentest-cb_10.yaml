- en: Most of the IoT devices out in the market today fail in terms of hardware security,
    that is, protecting access to the hardware from attackers. Be it an IP camera,
    baby monitor, medical device, enterprise IoT, smart wearables, or smart TVs, as
    soon as you start looking at its security, there is a high likelihood that a moderately
    skilled attacker would be able to open up the device (thanks to no/little protection
    against opening up the device), read the various chips, identify datasheets for
    them (due to missing protection for hiding the identities of chips), get access
    to the data in the chip (when there is no protection against getting access to
    the chips), interact with the device over various interfaces (because there is
    no protection against exposed interfaces), and more.

    manufacturers can take to secure the embedded device hardware used in IoT devices.
    Even though making a device 100% secure is close to impossible, the steps mentioned
    in this chapter will help to ensure that the devices that you work on are adhering
    to a really good security posture, which is tough for attackers to break into.

- en: One of the things to keep in consideration while building embedded devices is
    that most of the hardware-based vulnerabilities can't be fixed once the product
    is out in the market. This means that you need to be extremely careful from the
    very start when working with hardware.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The other thing to note while building hardware devices for IoT solutions is
    to always think about the resources that an attacker would get access to if he
    is able to reach the hardware. This means that if an attacker is able to open
    up the IoT device what visible components would be seen by him if he looked at
    the PCB. Moreover, what could the attacker do if he went a step further and had
    access to the hardware interface via a shell.

    chips on the PCB and various exposed interfaces. This can be protected to an extent
    using uncommon screws, which are tough to open or by using things such as ultrasonic
    welding or high-temperature glue to seal the multiple hardware enclosures together.

    for attackers to open up your device, and the only option in most cases would
    be to break it open. Force opening, and even normal opening, can be resisted by
    adding components, which sense and detect the opening of a device, which is discussed
    in the next section.

- en: Tamper resistance means using specialized components to protect against tampering
    with a given device. One of the common and effective ways of implementing antitampering,
    which can strengthen the hardware security of a device, is by adding tamper detection
    switches, sensors, or circuitry in the device, which can detect certain actions
    such as the opening of the device or its forceful breakage, and would act based
    on that by deleting the flash memory, or making the device unusable.

    by removing their labels, hiding them with epoxy, and even encapsulating the chips
    in a secure enclosure.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    tight airflow channels, security screws and hardened steel enclosures-all of which
    would make tampering with the device extremely difficult.

  prefs:

    and enable encryption. However, attacks exist whereby encryption can be bypassed,
    or the key can be obtained extremely easily.

- en: Side channel attacks are an advanced hardware exploitation technique in which
    an attacker uses different information sources, such as variations in power, timing
    analysis, electromagnetic data variations, and sound information, to extract more
    information, which can be used to compromise the target device.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Direct memory attacks** (**DMA**) are a type of side channel attack, which
    let the attacker access one of the components involved in the functionality of
    a certain activity *directly* instead of going the usual route. For example, if
    we take an example of a USB, the USB connects to the controller hub/**platform
    controller hub** (**PCH**), which can be accessed via **direct memory access**
    (**DMA**).'

    passed outside the system-be it electromagnetic radiations or sounds.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One of the most important things for securing hardware in IoT devices is to
    disable and remove the UART and JTAG interfaces, as well as any other diagnostic
    functionality in the hardware when the device is launched to the market.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The other important consideration here is that, even if there are no exposed
    interfaces visible, an attacker can directly hook to the legs of the chip to get
    access to the UART, JTAG, and so on. This is done by reading the datasheet of
    the chipset, figuring out which pins are for what functionalities, and then making
    the necessary connections. One of the steps that could be taken here to add a
    bit of complexity is to have the interfaces deep between different layers via
    *vias* and not exposed on one of the visible layers. However, this should be done
    only if the exposed interfaces are required for the device developer at a later
    point in time. In all other practical cases, these interfaces should be removed.
    Another security protection worth noting is the addition of hardware and software
    fuses, which can prevent the chips from being read or written to.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One of the things to note here is that basic protection mechanisms, such as
    cutting off tracks, are highly inefficient and can be worked around by a moderately
    skilled attacker.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, by using a solder bridge, the cut track can be joined together to re-enable
    the JTAG, further exploiting it using other techniques.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Even though encryption would be a part of firmware security, attackers can often
    sniff the data being passed between two different hardware components. To ensure
    that none of your sensitive information is getting into the hands of attackers,
    make sure that you are encrypting data that is in transit as well as at rest.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One of the other things to consider when talking about encryption in embedded
    devices is the amount of resources it would take to perform a certain encryption
    function.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Since the devices are low on resources, performing extremely strong crypto wouldn't
    be feasible-thus, a good balance between encryption and usability should be thought
    about ahead of time and implemented in the hardware.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If possible and when the chip supports it take advantage of the TPM to store
    all the various cryptographic keys, which can also provide functionalities such
    as a root of trust, preventing modifications to the boot up process. Most TPMs
    support an effective hardware random number generator and the ability to compute
    2048-bit RSA signatures in 200 ms.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In case TPM-bases security is not possible, another alternative is to use a
    copy protection dongle or a **hardware security module** (**HSM**), where the
    cryptographic keys will be stored. This can also be used during the runtime of
    the device to prevent against attacks, such as firmware modifications and backdooring,
    which makes the device security stronger.
