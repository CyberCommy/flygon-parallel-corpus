    a process recorded in the Bootstrap `package.json` file. Likewise, `npm run watch`
    sets up an automated process to scan for changed files and rebuilds Bootstrap
    upon changing any file. Running `npm run clean` will delete the Bootstrap source
    tree. By adding these lines to our `theme/package.json` file, we can start this
    in the Terminal and we can now rerun the build as needed without having to scratch
    our heads, struggling to remember what to do.

    to pull in all Bootstrap components. The file `bootstrap-4.5.0/scss/_variables.scss` contains
    definitions used in the remainder of the Bootstrap SASS source. Editing or overriding
    these values will change the look of websites using the resulting Bootstrap build.

    The Notes app will now use white text on a dark background, rather than the default
    white background with dark text. Because these declarations do not use `!default`,
    they'll override the values in `_variables.scss`.

    material, we have only touched the surface, and we could have done much more with
    our *Notes* application. But since our focus in this book is not on the UI, but
    on the backend Node.js code, we purposely limited ourselves to making the application
    work acceptably well on mobile devices.

    a simple responsive website design. Even the little changes we made improved the
