    penetration testing. All these phases are equally important to achieve accurate
    and reliable results but need to be completed with the final phase, which is the
    reporting phase.

- en: The reporting phase is often underestimated in its importance and considered
    as the boring, though necessary, part of a penetration test. Of course, the discovery
    and attack phases are the core and most exciting parts as it is when the penetration
    tester's technical skills are applied in practice. Penetration testers could be
    very skilled and might do an excellent job, but if they somehow fail to communicate
    their achievements to the customer effectively, their job is (at least in part)
    in vain.

    and the contents of the report, as well as the estimated time we are going to
    dedicate to writing it. Defining the objectives means explaining why the test
    has been conducted and the benefits that will derive from it, helping both the
    penetration tester and the customer to focus on the most important points. The
    target audience of the report is usually formed by both the management and the
    executives of the organization/company and the IT managers and staff, in particular
    the Information Security team, if present in the organization. Depending on the
    type of audience, the layout and the contents of the report can be divided in
    two main parts: the **executive summary** and the **technical report**. We will
    cover both later in the relative dedicated sections. Defining the audience also
    implies defining the classification and the distribution of the report. The classification
    of a document, generally speaking, establishes its level of confidentiality and
    therefore the people that are allowed to read it.'

- en: The distribution is about how to deliver it to the right persons and in a secure
    manner. For example, if we have to send the report by e-mail, it would be advisable
    to send it within an encrypted message, using public encryption tools, such as
    GnuPGP. Indeed, a penetration testing report contains critical information that
    could be used to attack the network and the systems of the organization if it
    falls in the wrong hands!

    options to save the outputs in the text readable formats, such as CSV and XML.

    step is to write the first draft of the report. In this stage, we organize all
    the collected information in a structured way and we describe all the steps performed
    during the penetration test. The writing of the report should follow a format,
    as we will see later in this chapter. The first draft writing usually takes about

    adopted to conduct the tests, which could include, among others, the certifications
    owned by the penetration testers, the type of software used (commercial or open
    source) and how the risk rating of the vulnerabilities is calculated. For example,
    a free and open standard to assess the severity of a vulnerability is the **Common
    Vulnerability Scoring System** (**CVSS**).

    but also comprises presenting and explaining it to the customer. In fact, even

    explanations by the penetration tester(s).
