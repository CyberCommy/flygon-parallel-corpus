- en: Starting with version 1.14, Kubernetes has brought the most anticipated feature
    of the year 2019: production-level support for Windows Server container workloads.
    This is a huge milestone that enables migration to cloud-native technologies for
    all enterprises that rely heavily on Windows technologies at their core. Developers
    and system operators can now leverage the same tools and pipelines to deploy both
    Windows and Linux workloads, scale them in a similar way, and undertake efficient
    monitoring. From a business perspective, container adoption for Windows means
    lower operational costs and better hardware utilization than plain VMs.

- en: You are holding in your hands a book that will guide you in terms of how to
    use Kubernetes and Docker containers in the Microsoft Windows ecosystem – it covers
    both hybrid Windows/Linux Kubernetes cluster deployment and handles cluster operations
    using a Windows client machine. Since support for Windows in Kubernetes is a fairly new
    concept, you can expect the official documentation and guides to still be scarce.
    In this book, we aim to systematize your knowledge regarding Kubernetes scenarios
    that involve Windows. Our aim was to create the ultimate guide for Kubernetes
    on Windows.

- en: The primary audience for this book is Kubernetes DevOps architects and engineers
    who need to integrate Windows container workloads into their Kubernetes clusters.
    If you are a Windows application (especially .NET Framework) developer and you
    haven't used Kubernetes yet, this book is also for you! In addition to the strategies
    regarding the deployment of hybrid Windows/Linux Kubernetes clusters, we cover
    the fundamental concepts behind Kubernetes and how they map to the Windows environment.
    And if you are interested in migrating existing .NET Framework applications to
    Windows Server containers running on Kubernetes, you will definitely find guidance
    in terms of how to approach this problem.
