    screen. In the previous chapter, you also learned how to set up your working environment.
    We showed you how simple it is to use Android tools. You also defined some flavors
    and build types. Let's take control over it! It's time to do your first build
    and run it on a device or an emulator. You will try it with all build types and
    flavor combinations.

    Your application becomes really big, and it also executes some expensive operations.
    Running it directly in Debug mode can be very difficult and time consuming. We
    will lose a significant amount of time until it enters the break point we are
    interested in. What can we do about it? Applications running in debug mode are
    slower, and we have a slow and big application. How to skip the part where we
    are losing our precious time? We will demonstrate. Run your application by clicking
    on the Run icon or by choosing Run | Run ''app''. The application is executed
    and started on our deployment target (real device or emulator). Attach the debugger
