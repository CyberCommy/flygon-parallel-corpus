    (JVM) on Your Computer*, introduces Java as a language and as a tool. It describes
    the motivation for Java creation, its history, its editions, architectural principles, and
    components. It also outlines the Java marketing position and the main areas of
    application. Then, a sequence of practical steps walk you through the process
    of Java machine installation and configuration on your computers and through its
    usage and main commands.'
