- en: The CompTIA Linux+ Certification Guide is an overview of the certification that
    gives you insights into the system architecture. You'll understand how to install
    and uninstall Linux distribution, followed by working with various package managers.
    Once you've grasped all this, you'll move on to manipulating files and processes
    at command-line interface (CLI) and creating, monitoring, killing, restarting,
    and modifying processes. As you progress, you'll be equipped to work with display
    managers and learn how to create, modify, and remove user accounts and groups,
    as well as understand how to automate tasks. The last set of chapters helps you
    configure dates and set up local and remote system logging. In addition to this,
    you'll explore different internet protocols, along with discovering network configuration,
    security administration, Shell scripting and SQL management.

    Linux distributions; namely CentOS, Fedora, and Ubuntu. Then install the various
    Operating Systems in a virtual environment such as VMware or VirtualBox. Next,
    follow along each chapters (the chapters are independent of each other so you
    can choose any given chapter to study/practice) by practicing inside the various
    Linux distributions in order to better grasp each chapter. After practicing the
    various chapters, you will become more productive within a Linux environment;
    this will empower you to be better equipped in mixed environments where there
