- en: Kubernetes has been one of the standout technologies of the last few years;
    it has been adopted as a container clustering and orchestration platform by all
    the major public cloud providers, and it has quickly become the standard across
    the industry.

- en: Add to this that Kubernetes is open source, and you have the perfect base for
    hosting your own Platform as a Service or PaaS across multiple public and private
    providers; you can even run it on a laptop and, due to its design, you will get
    a consistent experience across all of your platforms.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Its design also makes it the perfect platform for running serverless functions.
    In this book, we will look at several platforms that can be both deployed on and
    integrated with Kubernetes, meaning that not only will we have PaaS but also a
    robust Function as a Service platform running in your Kubernetes environment.

    of the tools will have installation instructions and details of its requirements
    in the chapters. Note that while instructions for Windows systems are provided,
    a lot of the tools we will be using were originally designed to run primarily
    on Linux/Unix based systems such as Ubuntu 17.04 and macOS High Sierra, and the
    book will favor these systems. While every effort has been made at the time of
    writing to verify that the tools work on Windows-based systems, as some of the
    tools are experimental builds, we cannot guarantee that they will continue to
    work on updated systems, because of this, I would recommend using either a Linux-
    or Unix-based system.
