    testing, specifically using mobile devices to execute real-world, simulated attacks,
    and analyses on a target system or network. However, selecting an appropriate
    device for Kali Linux can sometimes be a bit troublesome. As a student, security
    professional, penetration tester, or someone who is starting a path in cybersecurity,
    especially in penetration testing, you may have the following questions:'

    developed to be either installed on the local **hard disk drive** (**HDD**) of
    a computer or live-booted from an optical disk, such as a **digital versatile
    disk** (**DVD**). Over the years, the development of Kali Linux expanded to newer
    and more modern devices, such as smartphones and tablets, and even other devices
    with **Advanced RISC Machines** (**ARM**) processors, such as a Raspberry Pi.

    Linux operating system. These devices would allow a penetration tester to create
    their own network implants for a target network. We covered the supported list
    of mobile devices when reviewing methods of compiling a custom Kali NetHunter
    image for a specific device. Finally, penetration testing is never complete without
    a wireless network adapter, so a list of known supported wireless adapters for
    mobile devices was provided.
