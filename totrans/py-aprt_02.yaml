    are lots of good answers to those questions. One is that Python is powerful. The
    Python language is expressive and productive, it comes with a [great standard
    library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html), and it’s the center of
    a [huge universe of wonderful third-party libraries](https://pypi.python.org/pypi).
    With Python you can build everything from simple scripts to complex applications,
    you can do it quickly, you can do it safely, and you can do it with fewer lines
    of code than you might think possible.

    is wonderfully open. It’s open-source, so you can [get to know every aspect of
    it](https://docs.python.org/devguide/setup.html) if you want. At the same time,
    Python is hugely popular and has a [great community to support you](https://www.python.org/community/)
    when you run into trouble. This combination of openness and large userbase means
    that almost anyone – from casual programmers to professional software developers
    – can engage with the language at the level they need.

    more places. You may be wanting learn Python simply because it’s the language
    of some technology you want to use, and this is not surprising – many of the most
    popular web and scientific packages in the world are written in Python.

    Python is fun! Python’s expressive, readable style, quick edit-and-run development
    cycle, and “batteries included” philosophy mean that you can sit down and enjoy
    writing code rather than fighting compilers and thorny syntax. And Python will
    grow with you. As your experiments become prototypes and your prototypes become
    products, Python makes the experience of writing software not just easier but
    truly enjoyable.'
