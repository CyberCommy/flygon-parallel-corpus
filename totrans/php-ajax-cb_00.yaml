- en: Ajax is the necessary paradigm in Web 2.0 sites. Most Web 2.0 sites are built
    with PHP and Ajax. Extending Ajax is about delivering front-end services for accessing
    back-end services in PHP in a quick and easy manner. With this book in hand, you
    will learn how to use the necessary tools for Ajaxification of websites and iPhones.

- en: The *PHP Ajax Cookbook* will teach you how to use the combination of PHP and
    Ajax as a powerful platform for websites or web applications. Using Ajax for communication
    with the server leads to faster response with PHP at the back-end services. The
    combination of Ajax and PHP has many features such as speeding up the user experience,
    giving your web client much quicker response time, and letting the client browser
    retrieve data from the server without having to refresh the whole page. You will
    learn the nuances of optimization and debugging Ajax applications. Further, you
    will learn how to program Ajax on iPhone devices.

    concepts on debugging, optimization, and best practices. There is a collection
    of recipes focused on creating basic utilities such as validating forms using

    learn to visually speed up website responsiveness and build SEO-friendly Ajax
    websites. You will also get to know about all popular Ajax webservices and APIs
    like Twitter, Facebook and Google Maps, which are covered in [Chapter 8](ch08.html
