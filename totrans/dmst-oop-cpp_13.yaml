- en: The initial chapter in this section explores exception handling in C++ through
    understanding the mechanisms of try, throw, and catch, and through examining many
    examples to explore exception mechanics by delving into various exception handling
    scenarios. Additionally, this chapter expands exception class hierarchies with
    new exception classes.

- en: The next chapter digs into the topics of the proper usage of friend functions
    and friend classes as well as operator overloading (which may sometimes require
    friends) to make operations polymorphic between built-in and user defined types.

- en: The following chapter explores using C++ templates to help make code generic
    and usable for a variety of data types using template functions and template classes.
    Additionally, this chapter explains how operator overloading will assist in making
    template code extensible for virtually any data type.

- en: In the next chapter, the Standard Template Library in C++ is introduced and
    core STL containers such as list, iterator, deque, stack, queue, priority_queue
    and map are examined. Additionally, STL algorithms and functors are introduced.

- en: The final chapter in this section surveys testing OO programs and components
    through exploring the canonical class form, creating drivers for component testing,
    testing classes related through inheritance, association and aggregation, and
    testing exception handling mechanisms.
