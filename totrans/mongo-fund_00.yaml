    collections of data. This book will help MongoDB beginners develop the knowledge
    and skills to create databases and process data efficiently.

- en: Unlike other MongoDB books, *MongoDB Fundamentals* dives into cloud computing
    from the very start – showing you how to get started with Atlas in the first chapter.
    You will discover how to modify existing data, add new data into a database, and
    handle complex queries by creating aggregation pipelines. As you progress, you'll
    learn about the MongoDB replication architecture and configure a simple cluster.
    You will also get to grips with user authentication, as well as techniques for
    backing up and restoring data. Finally, you'll perform data visualization using
    MongoDB Charts.

    a real-world problem based on a bike-sharing app.

    commands into the console. However, this method will only get you so far and will
    end up being more of a burden as you perform more advanced operations. For this
    reason, we recommend having a text editor ready to write your commands down, and
    these can then be copied into the shell. Although any text editor will work, if
    you don't already have a preference, we recommend Visual Studio Code as it has
    some helpful plugins for MongoDB. That being said, whatever tools you are comfortable
