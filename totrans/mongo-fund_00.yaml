- en: MongoDB is one of the most popular database technologies for handling large
    collections of data. This book will help MongoDB beginners develop the knowledge
    and skills to create databases and process data efficiently.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Unlike other MongoDB books, *MongoDB Fundamentals* dives into cloud computing
    from the very start – showing you how to get started with Atlas in the first chapter.
    You will discover how to modify existing data, add new data into a database, and
    handle complex queries by creating aggregation pipelines. As you progress, you'll
    learn about the MongoDB replication architecture and configure a simple cluster.
    You will also get to grips with user authentication, as well as techniques for
    backing up and restoring data. Finally, you'll perform data visualization using
    MongoDB Charts.

- en: You will work on realistic projects that are presented as bitesize exercises
    and activities, allowing you to challenge yourself in an enjoyable and attainable
    way. Many of these mini-projects are based around a movie database case study,
    while the last chapter acts as a final project where you will use MongoDB to solve
    a real-world problem based on a bike-sharing app.

    volumes of data and tackle your own projects using MongoDB.

- en: The MongoDB shell allows you to directly interact with databases by merely typing
    commands into the console. However, this method will only get you so far and will
    end up being more of a burden as you perform more advanced operations. For this
    reason, we recommend having a text editor ready to write your commands down, and
    these can then be copied into the shell. Although any text editor will work, if
    you don't already have a preference, we recommend Visual Studio Code as it has
    some helpful plugins for MongoDB. That being said, whatever tools you are comfortable
    with will be more than enough for this book.
