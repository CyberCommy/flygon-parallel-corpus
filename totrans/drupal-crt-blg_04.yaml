- en: With the general configuration tasks behind us, I am sure you are more than
    keen to begin working on the layout and functionality for the site. That's not
    to say we are going to discuss the type of layout that involves themes just yet,
    because there is plenty of work to be done deciding what goes where before we
    look at things like fonts, colors, and images. While we aren't working with anything
    as exciting as new images or flashy graphics, you will find that much of what
    we cover in this section is a matter of taste, and you can get fairly creative.

- en: '*So how do we go about building a fully functional website?* The answer is
    to use chunks of free‑standing code called modules, which either come as part
    of the standard Drupal download, or are provided by the good people of the Drupal
    community. Modules simply sit around waiting till you need them, at which point,
    Drupal (knowing how to make use of them) calls on all the functionalities provided
    by the module file(s) in order to fulfill the tasks required of it.'

  zh: '*那么我们如何构建一个完全功能的网站呢？*答案是使用称为模块的独立代码块，这些模块要么作为标准Drupal下载的一部分，要么由Drupal社区的热心人提供。模块只是静静地等待，直到你需要它们，此时，Drupal（知道如何利用它们）调用模块文件提供的所有功能，以完成所需的任务。'
- en: The terms *module* and *functionality*, with respect to Drupal, are synonymous,
    from the point of view that modules provide functionality. It is possible to add
    your own functionality directly to your pages too, but that is a slightly different
    matter, which we will get into later. For now, the discussion of your site's functionality
    is really a discussion about modules.

- en: One of the greatest things about Drupal is that it adheres to the open-source
    paradigm. This fosters community development, which in turn promotes and increases
    the diversity of any given project. One of the spin-offs from this is that community
    members who overcome certain obstacles or create something new and useful can,
    and often do, take the time to share it with everyone else. This is an exceptionally
    valuable property of most, if not all, open-source projects.

    of modules that have been made by someone, improved on by someone else, or changed
    into something else, and pick and choose what we like the most. The converse of
    this is, of course, that you can make any of your own developments available for
    everyone else to use when the time comes.

    such as the one we are going to incorporate into our site here. It is important
    to understand that people are providing useful software without enforcing payment.
    Hopefully, you will take it upon yourself to drop the developers a line every
    now and then to thank them for any functionality they have spent time and effort
    on that you may benefit from.

- en: Secondly, because more often then not there is only one developer or a small
    group of developers, you need to understand that there is no huge budget, with
    lots of computer geeks tapping away day and night. This means that contributions,
    like any software, are subject to bugs or errors, and you should always make sure
    that your site, including the database, are protected by making backups before
    implementing any changes. (For more information on properly backing up your site,
    see [Chapter 10](ch10.html "Chapter 10. Running Your Website")) This is in line
    with best practices when it comes to dealing with software—if something breaks
    your code, then it is your responsibility, and not the contributor's.

    the correct version is very important because you cannot assume that a module
    developed for the **4.6.x** family will work with the latest **4.7.x** family.
    In fact, it is probably a bigger issue now than it will be in a year or so, since
    Drupal has only just reached the **4.7.x** family. Unfortunately, the upgrading
    of contributions is not necessarily done at the same time as the core development;
    so it may be that there are some modules you can only implement in older versions
    of Drupal—hopefully by the time you read this, most modules, if not all, will
    have been made compatible with **4.7.x**.

    section, assuming you are searching by category. Navigate there, click **Download**,
    and save the zipped file to your machine. You might find it more expedient to
    create a directory, say `drupal_downloads`, to save these files to. Of course,
    once the module is installed you no longer need the zip file. It may be useful
    to maintain a copy just in case, but if you are certain you won't need it again,
    remove it once everything is up and running.

    e-commerce website, complete with products or services and a shopping cart?* You
    can implement all types of payment facilities such as PayPal, or credit cards

- en: Open up the `.gz` file that you saved on your machine (refer to the previous
    section). Depending on the module in question you will have anywhere from one
    file to tens of files. As many will have license information in them, ensure that
    you take the time to read over these before you go ahead and use them. Apart from
    that, the first thing you need to do is open up the `readme` file as this will,
    more than likely, have some detailed information on what you can expect from the
    module, and how it functions.

- en: Assuming you are happy you have the right module for the job, the next file
    to open up is the install file, usually something like `INSTALL.txt`. This will
    give you a list of instructions to follow in order to set things up properly.
    More often than not, this involves making some sort of adjustment to your database

    the contribution. For example, in the case of the Taxonomy Access Control module,
    we are advised not to use it in conjunction with other access-related modules
    such as **OG** or **node_privacy_by_role**. That doesn't mean you can not—just
    that you should ensure you know exactly what you are doing before going against

    plug-n-play type of setup where all that you need to do extract the module file

    of interest to the demo site's target audience. The environment is also an issue

    sub-categories that users would intuitively understand as topics for debate—we'll

- en: There are a few things to note here. First of all, there is some overlap in
    terms of how categories mesh on a conceptual level. For example, **Global Warming**
    should logically appear under **Environmental Impact**, so *why does it have its
    own forum?* The answer is that you need to think about which issues are likely
    to be most important. As global warming is a huge issue, it warrants a promotion
    to its own forum.

  zh: 这里有几点需要注意。首先，在概念层面上，类别之间存在一些重叠。例如，**全球变暖**在逻辑上应该出现在**环境影响**下，那么*为什么它有自己的论坛呢？*答案是您需要考虑哪些问题可能最重要。由于全球变暖是一个重大问题，它值得提升为自己的论坛。
- en: Secondly, I have only added a single parent layer of containers, with forums
    appearing under this. It is possible to add containers within containers and so
    on, but in the interests of making it easy to find topics, you should try keeping
    a flat structure instead of creating a deep navigation structure wherever possible.
    This is because it is easier for people to search a list than to navigate a deep
    hierarchy.

  zh: 其次，我只添加了一个单一的父级容器层，论坛出现在其下。可以在容器内部添加容器等等，但为了方便查找主题，您应该尽量保持扁平的结构，而不是创建深层次的导航结构。这是因为人们更容易搜索列表，而不是导航深层次的层次结构。

    For a start, the indexing process that is used to build the search in the database
    relies on cron (discussed in [Chapter 10](ch10.html "Chapter 10. Running Your
    Website")). You will need to ensure that you have this operating correctly on
    your live site if you are going to implement a search feature. For more information

    site** button at the top of the search page, under the **settings** menu item.

- en: Most of the other settings in this section relate to the performance of the
    system. For example, as the number of items you choose to index per cron run will
    also affect the speed of the cron job, you might have to make this setting a little
    lower if you are running into time-out problems. As well as this, indexing shorter
    words adds load to your system, because it has to index that many more words in
    the content.

  zh: 此部分中的大多数其他设置与系统的性能有关。例如，您选择每个cron运行索引的项目数量也会影响cron作业的速度，如果遇到超时问题，可能需要将此设置稍微降低。此外，索引较短的单词会增加系统的负载，因为它必须索引更多的内容中的单词。
- en: 'Finally, it is possible to decide on how to weigh the site search based on
    three criteria, namely **Keyword relevance, Recently posted**, and **Number of
    comments**. You need to work out which criterion is more important, and which

    to hinge on whether there is a strong correlation between the search terms and
    the content. Effectively, we are saying that just because a posting is new, doesn't
    make it more worthwhile, and just because a piece of content has been commented
    on extensively, doesn't make it more relevant. Depending on your criteria, you
    may choose something completely different—the bottom line is to ensure that the
    search results are as relevant as possible to the site's users.

    don't want to run the risk of spreading them around by allowing `.exe` or other
    executable files to be made available. Further, you need to think about how much
    disk space there is available. The last thing you want to do is allow people to
    upload entire movie files that can take up gigabytes of space at a time; so ensure

    Environment"), blocks contain information or related data that is visible in various
    places around the site—depending on where you choose to show them. Blocks are
    often generated by modules, but it is also possible to create them manually. Since
    many modules generate blocks automatically, it is always wise to pay the **blocks**
    section a visit whenever a new module has been enabled, because chances are that
    you have some new settings to play with.

    should strive to make a striking and unique site, and layout configuration is

    and layout, among other things (the scope of themes is actually very broad but
    for the time being it is fine to look at things in this way), whereas we would
    still need to enable and add blocks to certain parts of the site regardless of
    what template/theme we were using.

    negative numbers that allow you to give weightings of less than **0** so that
    you don't have to redo all the weightings to insert one above. Accordingly, if
    you wanted to add two more blocks to the top of the right sidebar, you could give
