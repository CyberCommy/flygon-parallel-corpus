    can get started with developing GIS applications with the ArcGIS API for JavaScript.
    For those of you already familiar with HTML, JavaScript, and CSS, you may wish
    to skip ahead to the next chapter. However, if you're new to any of these concepts,
    read on. We are going to cover these topics at a very basic level, just enough
    to get you started. For a more advanced treatment on any of these subjects, there
    are many learning resources available, including books and online tutorials. You
    can refer to [Appendix](apa.html "Appendix A. Application Design with ArcGIS Templates
    and Dojo"), *Application Design with ArcGIS Templates and Dojo*, for a more comprehensive
    list of these resources.

    you need to understand the context of where the code will be placed when you're
    developing applications with the ArcGIS API for JavaScript. The code you write
    will be placed inside an HTML page or a JavaScript file. HTML files typically
    have an `.html` or `.htm` file extension and JavaScript files have a `.js` extension.
    Once you have created a basic HTML page, you can go through the steps required
    to create a basic map with the ArcGIS API for JavaScript.

    tags must be placed inside this tag. Tags that define how the web page will appear
    in the browser are placed inside the `<body>` tag. For instance, your mapping
    applications will contain a `<div>` tag inside the `<body>` tag that is used as
    a container for displaying the map.

    use to associate with some type of data value. At a lower level, these variables
    are areas of space carved out in a computer's memory that store data.

    of data. When we initially create the variable, it is empty until data is assigned.
    Basically, variables give us the ability to store and manipulate data. In the
    following diagram, we create a variable called `ssn`. Initially, this variable
    is empty but is then assigned a value of `450-63-3567`. The data value assigned
    to a variable can be of various types, including numbers, strings, booleans, objects,
    and arrays.

    Unlike other strongly-typed languages such as .NET or C++, JavaScript is a loosely-typed

    assigned to string variables through the use of single or double quotes that enclose
    the value. This can be confusing at times for some new programmers. For instance,

    value of 3.14 with single or double quotes is assigned a string data type.

    most important concept in this section. In order to effectively program mapping
    applications with the ArcGIS API for JavaScript, you need to have a good fundamental
    understanding of objects. So, this is a critical concept that you need to grasp
    to understand how to develop web-mapping applications.
  id: totrans-91

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The ArcGIS API for JavaScript makes extensive use of objects. We'll cover the
    details of this programming library in detail, but for now we'll hit the high-level
    concepts. Objects are complex structures capable of aggregating multiple data
    values and actions into a single structure. This differs greatly from our primitive
    datatypes, such as numbers, strings, and booleans, which can hold only a single
    value. Objects are much more complex structures.
  id: totrans-92
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Objects are composed of both data and actions. Data, in the form of properties,
    contains information about an object. For example, with a `Map` object found in
    the ArcGIS API for JavaScript, there are a number of properties, including the
    map extent, graphics associated with a map, the height and width of the map, layer
    IDs associated with the map, and others. These properties contain information
    about the object.
  id: totrans-93
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Objects also have actions that we typically call methods, but we can also group
    constructors and events into this category. Methods are actions that a map can
    perform, such as adding a layer, setting the map extent, or getting the map scale.

    code example shows how a constructor is used to create a new instance of a `Map`
    object. You can tell that this method is a constructor because of the use of the
    `new` keyword that I''ve highlighted. The `new` keyword, followed by the name
    of the object and any parameters used to control the `new` object, defines the
    constructor for the object. In this case, we''ve created a new `Map` object and
    stored it in a variable called `map`. Three parameters are passed into the constructor
    to control various aspects of the `Map` object including `basemap`, `center` of
    the map, and the `zoom` scale level:'

    As you now know, styles can be defined in external stylesheets, internal stylesheets,
    or inline. There is a fourth level that we didn't discuss, which is the browser
    default. You don't have any control over that though. In CSS, an inline style
    has the highest priority, which means that it will override a style defined in
    an internal stylesheet, an external stylesheet, or the browser default. If an
    inline style is not defined, any style rule defined in an internal stylesheet
    would take precedence over styles defined in an external stylesheet. The caveat
    here is that if a link to an external stylesheet is placed after the internal
    stylesheet in HTML `<head>`, the external stylesheet will override the internal
    sheet!

    HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code in the same file or split them into separate files?
    For very simple applications and examples, it is not uncommon for all the code
    to be placed into a single file with an extension of `.html` or `.htm`. In this
    case, the CSS and JavaScript code will reside in the `<head>` section of your
    HTML page. However, the preferred way of creating an application using this code
    stack is to separate the presentation from the content and behavior. The user
    interface items for your application should reside in an HTML page that contains
    only tags used to define the content of the application, along with references
    to any CSS (presentation) or JavaScript (behavior) files that are part of the
    application. The end result is a single HTML page and one or more CSS and JavaScript
    files. This would result in a folder structure similar to that shown in the following
    screenshot, where we have a single file called `index.html` and several folders
    that hold CSS, JavaScript, and other resources, such as images. The `css` and
    `js` folders will contain one or more files.
