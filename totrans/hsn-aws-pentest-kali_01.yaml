- en: This section is a beginner-oriented introduction to how an individual without
    access to a ready-made AWS environment can set up a lab to practice their pentesting
    skills, as well as the ways in which they may practice their skills. It also walks
    the reader through the process of setting up a Kali pentestbox on AWS that can
    be easily accessed on the go, using nothing more than a web browser.
