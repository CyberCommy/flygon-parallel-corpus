- en: Angular is one of the most popular frameworks in the world for building not
    only web applications but even mobile and desktop applications as well. Backed
    by Google and used by Google, this framework is used by millions of applications.
    Although the framework is well suited for any scale of application, enterprises
    especially like Angular because of it being opinionated and because of its consistent
    ecosystem that includes all the tools you need to create a web technologies-based
    application.

- en: While learning the core technologies such as JavaScript, HTML, and CSS is an
    absolute essential to progress as a web developer, when it comes to a framework,
    learning the core concepts of the framework itself is pretty important too. When
    we're dealing with Angular, there are a lot of amazing things we can do with our
    web applications by learning about, and using, the right tools in the Angular
    ecosystem. That's where this book comes in.

- en: This book was written for intermediate and advanced Angular developers to polish
    their Angular development skills with recipes that you can follow easily, play
    around with, and practice your own variations of. You'll not only learn from the
    recipes themselves but also from the actual real-life projects associated with
    the recipes. So, there are a lot of hidden gems in these recipes and projects
    for you.
