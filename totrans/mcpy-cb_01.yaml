    tiny and inexpensive hardware devices more accessible, as you can use a high-level
    language such as Python to code on them. Tasks such as retrieving data from web
    services can easily be done in a few lines of code, compared to other microcontroller
    languages that would require many more steps, because they operate at such a low
    level compared to Python. This is very empowering, as you will get results faster
    and be able to iterate through different designs and prototypes in a shorter amount
    of time.

    learn how to update the firmware and libraries on the device. Recipes to load
    your first program on the board and use advanced features, such as auto-reloading
    your code, will also be covered. Finally, a number of recipes will cover the usage
    of the REPL that is a powerful way to quickly interact and experiment with the
    available components on MicroPython devices.

    George, who launched a Kickstarter campaign in 2013 to support the development
    of the language and the initial microcontroller hardware that it would run on.
    After the success of the project, more and more devices (which have a variety
    of chipsets from different manufactures) have become supported by MicroPython,
    creating a wide range of devices from which to choose when you make a project
    using MicroPython.

    is capable of running on hardware with very limited resources, such as microcontrollers.
    MicroPython has implemented the majority of features in the Python programming
    language, such as functions, classes, lists, dictionaries, strings, reading and
    writing files, list comprehensions, and exception handling.

    is that it does not run on an **operating system** (**OS**), but instead runs
    directly on bare metal. These unique characteristics manifest themselves in many
    ways, such as the ability to run your Python code at the instant the hardware
    is powered on, as there is no OS that needs to boot up.

    consumption is often far less in orders of magnitude, thus providing battery life

    delicate process of flashing a microcontroller. Microsoft developed the UF2 method,
    which greatly simplifies the process by not requiring any special software or
    command-line execution to flash the microcontroller.
  id: totrans-75

    file to be saved to it. When the UF2 is copied to the drive, the microcontroller
    will detect that the file copy has been completed and then automatically proceed
    to flash the microcontroller and restart the device, at which point the device
    is reattached and ready to be used.

    and faster compared to previous approaches. Not all MicroPython boards support
    the UF2 method and so require the more involved approach of installing special
    software to do the firmware flashing. The exact process and software required
    varies between different boards and manufactures.

    the exact name of the serial device that the device appears as on your computer.
    The naming of these devices varies between Windows, Linux, and macOS. This type
    of software is usually required to be run in the Terminal, so you'll have to have
    some command-line knowledge to inter with it. For all these reasons, the use of
    UF2 with supported devices such as the Circuit Playground Express is the preferred
    way of starting your experimentation with MicroPython.

    using the REPL. This will give you a chance to get immediate feedback as you run
    each snippet of code. Once you've entered the different snippets in the REPL you
    can also use REPL features to assist in your experimentation with the code. You
    can use the *up* and *down* arrow keys to move through the history of commands
    that have been entered in the REPL. For example, if you had just executed a line
    of code in the REPL that turned on a specific pixel on the board, you could press
    the *up* key and change which pixel is lit up by editing the line and pressing
    *Enter* again.

    Many components on these microcontrollers can be fine-tuned for different project
    needs. The REPL frequently ends up being an ideal place to do this fine-tuning.
