- en: This guide will show you how to build your application in sandboxed Docker containers
    and make them run everywhere—your development machine, your private server, or
    even on the cloud, with a fraction of the cost of a virtual machine. Build a PaaS,
    deploy a cluster, and so on, all on your development setup.
