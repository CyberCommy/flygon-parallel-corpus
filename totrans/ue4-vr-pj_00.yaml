- en: '**Virtual reality** (**VR**) isn''t just the media we knew and loved from the
    twentieth century in a stereo headset. It''s much more than that. VR doesn''t
    simply show us images of the world around us in stereo 3D. In a literal sense,
    sure, that *is* what it does, but that''s a little like saying that music just
    wiggles the air around our ears. Technically true, but too reductive to let us
    understand it. VR plays with our senses and dances with the cognitive mechanisms
    by which we think we understand the world. To get VR and learn how to create for
    it, we have to accept that it is an entirely new medium, and what we don''t know
    about its language, rules, and methods far outweighs what we do know. This is
    powerful stuff, and, without question, VR or some variant of this technology is
    likely to be the defining art form of the twenty-first century.'

- en: You'd be right to greet this assertion with a bit of skepticism. Given the present
    state of the technology and of the industry, it takes some imagination to see
    beyond the horizon of where we are now. And you've probably seen by now that the
    public's expectations are in a race with the actual state of the technology and
    the art form. Sometimes, they lag behind its reality, and sometimes they jump
    ahead. Opinions about VR, therefore, are all over the place. If we're in one of
    those phases where the tech makes a leap forward, people get amazed and excited
    by the possibilities and the breathless blogs declare that the world has changed.
    If we're in one of those phases where the expectations have jumped ahead, suddenly
    everyone's disappointed that their first-generation Oculus Rift hasn't morphed
    overnight into the Holodeck and we see a lot of disillusionment on blogs. It's
    impossible to predict where the pendulum will be in its swing when you read this.

    now: VR is coming, it''s inevitable, and it changes everything, even if this isn''t
    yet obvious from the rudimentary state of the first-generation technology. This
    medium carries with it the potential to revolutionize the way we learn, play,
    engage the virtual world, and so much else. But it''s going to take time and imagination.'

- en: VR is a medium at a crossroads. The decisions we make now are going to carry
    us far into the future. The developers working in this medium will be the ones
    to shape its language and methods for the next generation. To work in VR is to
    work on a frontier, and that's an exciting place to be.

- en: In this book, we intend to give you a solid set of tools to begin your work
    on this frontier. This book uses a practical, hands-on approach to teach you how
    to build VR games and applications using the Unreal Engine. Each chapter walks
    you step-by-step through the process of building the essential building blocks
    of a VR application, and we pair these steps with in-depth explanations of what's
    really going on when you follow them and why things are done the way they are.
    It's this *why* that matters. Understanding how the underlying systems and ideas
    work is crucial to the work you'll do on your own after you've finished these
    tutorials, and, in this book, we've tried to give you both—an understanding of
    what to do to build a VR application, and the background you'll need in order
    to use this book as a springboard for your own work in VR.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You should come away from this book with a solid understanding of how VR applications
    are built, and what specifically you need to know and understand about the Unreal
    Engine to build them. It's our hope that the work we do together here will set
    you up to take your exploration into this new frontier wherever you want to go.

- en: If you're interested in creating VR games or applications, interested in seeing
    how VR could augment the work you do in your current field, or are just interested
    in exploring VR and seeing what it can do, this book is for you. You don't have
    to be an experienced engineer or even deeply experienced with Unreal Engine to
    benefit from this book; we explain everything as we go. Readers who are entirely
    new to Unreal Engine will find it helpful to run through Epic's getting started
    tutorials before diving in here, just so you know where everything is, but this
    book is entirely appropriate for both experienced Unreal users who need to learn
    specifically how Unreal works with VR, and for new Unreal users just finding their
    way around.

    been working in VR in another engine, or you know your way around Unreal but are
    new to VR, this book should be able to provide a lot of value. (And we hope even
    those already well versed in VR creation using Unreal Engine find a few interesting
    new perspectives and techniques as well.)

    it is helpful to have a sense of where things are. If you haven't yet installed
    Unreal Engine, don't worry—we'll cover this in [Chapter 2](24157dc8-09e6-4ff8-9ba2-3e0d0e4709b6.xhtml),
    *Setting Up Your Development Environment*, but if you've never used it before,

    started tutorials before diving back into this book just so you know where everything
    is.

    Rift and HTC Vive minimum specs, so whether you're on a desktop or a laptop, you
    should be fine provided your system meets these minimum specs. You should, of
    course, have a VR headset available, and if you're planning to develop for mobile
    VR, it's still recommended that you have a desktop VR headset available as well,
    since it will make testing dramatically easier. All of the software you'll be
    using through the course of this book is freely available online and we'll walk
    you through downloading and installing it, so there's nothing special you need
