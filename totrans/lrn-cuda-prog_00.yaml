- en: Traditionally, computing requirements were associated with **Central Processing
    Units** (**CPUs**), which have grown from having a single core to now having multiple
    cores. Every new generation of CPU has provided more performance, but the scientific
    and **High Performance Computing** (**HPC**) community has demanded more performance
    year on year, creating a compute gap between what applications have demanded and
    what hardware/software stacks could provide.  At the same time, new architecture
    that was traditionally used for video graphics found its way into the scientific
    domain. **Graphics Processing Units** (**GPUs**)—essentially parallel computing
    processors used to accelerate computer graphics—made their mark on the HPC domain
    in 2007 when **Compute Unified Device Architecture** (**CUDA**) was launched.
    CUDA grew to become the de facto standard when it comes to using GPUs for general-purpose
    computation; that is, non-graphic applications.

- en: There have been many releases of CUDA since its inception, and now CUDA stands
    at release 10.x. Each release provides new features that support the new hardware
    architecture. This book is designed to help you learn GPU parallel programming
    and guide you in its modern-day applications. With its help, you'll be able to
    discover CUDA programming approaches for modern GPU architectures. The book will
    not only guide you through GPU features, tools, and APIs, but also help you understand
    how to analyze performance with sample parallel programming algorithms. This book
    will ensure that you gain plenty of optimization experience and insights into
    CUDA programming platforms with various libraries, open accelerators (OpenACC),
    and other languages. As you progress, you'll discover how to generate additional
    computing power with multiple GPUs in a box, or multiple boxes. Finally, you'll
    explore how CUDA accelerates deep learning algorithms, including **convolutional
    neural networks** (**CNNs**) and **recurrent neural networks** (**RNNs**).

    But by the end of it, you will be able to write optimized CUDA code for different
    domains, including artificial intelligence.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This beginner-level book is for programmers who want to delve into parallel
    computing, become part of the high-performance computing community and build modern
    applications. Basic C and C++ programming experience is assumed. For deep learning
    enthusiasts, this book covers Python InterOps, DL libraries, and practical examples
    on performance estimation.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book is designed for complete beginners and people who have just started
    to learn parallel computing. It does not require any specific knowledge besides
    the basics of computer architecture, and experience with C/C++ programming is
    assumed. For deep learning enthusiasts, in [Chapter 10](d0e9e8ff-bc17-4031-bb0e-1cfd310aff6f.xhtml),
    *Deep Learning Acceleration with CUDA*, Python-based sample code is also provided,
    hence some Python knowledge is expected for that chapter specifically.

- en: The code for this book is primarily developed and tested in a Linux environment.
    Hence, familiarity with the Linux environment is helpful. Any of the latest Linux
    flavors, such as CentOS or Ubuntu, are okay. The code can be compiled either using
    a makefile or the command line. The book primarily uses a free software stack,
    so there is no need to buy any software licenses.  Two key pieces of software
    that will be used throughout are the CUDA Toolkit and PGI Community Edition.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Since the book primarily covers the latest GPU features making use of CUDA 10.x,
    in order to fully exploit all the training material, the latest GPU architecture
    (Pascal onward) will be beneficial. While not all chapters require the latest
    GPU, having the latest GPU will help you to reproduce the results achieved in
    the book. Each chapter has a section on the preferred or must-have GPU architecture
    in the *Technical requirements* section.
