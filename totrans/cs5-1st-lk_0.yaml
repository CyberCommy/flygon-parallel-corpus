- en: C# is a wonderfully expressive and powerful language that lets you focus on
    your application rather than low-level boilerplate. Over the last decade, the
    C# compiler has evolved to include many features from dynamic and functional languages,
    all while remaining statically typed. Most recently, it has tackled the proliferation
    of concurrent hardware with new asynchronous programming features.

    up your development environment, you will go on a tour of all the latest features
    of the language including the Task Parallel Framework, Dynamic Language Runtime,
    TPL Data Flow, and finally asynchronous programming with async and await.

    discusses asynchronous programming with a major focus on the 5.0 release. Starting
    with the Task Parallel Library (TPL), and culminating with the new async and await
    keywords that were newly introduced in this version of C#, you now have the ability
