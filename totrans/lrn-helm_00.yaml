- en: Presently, containerization is said to be the best way to implement DevOps.
    While Docker introduced containers and changed the DevOps era, Google developed
    an extensive container orchestration system, Kubernetes, which is now considered
    the frontrunner in container orchestration. The main goal of this book is to learn
    about the efficiency of managing applications running on Kubernetes using Helm.
    This book will start with a short introduction to Helm and how it can benefit
    the entire container environment. You will then dive into the architectural aspects,
    along with learning about Helm charts and its use cases. You’ll learn how to write
    Helm charts in order to automate application deployment on Kubernetes. Focused
    on providing enterprise-ready patterns around Helm and automation, the book covers
    best practices around application development, delivery, and life cycle management
    with Helm. By the end of this book, you will know how to leverage Helm to develop
    an enterprise pattern with a view to application delivery.

- en: This book targets Kubernetes developers or administrators interested in learning
    Helm to provide automation around application development on Kubernetes. Basic
    knowledge of Kubernetes application development would be useful, but prior knowledge
    of Helm is not required. Basic knowledge of business use cases that automation
    provides is recommended.

    of building a Helm chart. The chapter begins with the fundamental concepts of
    building a Helm chart that leverages basic Helm constructs and progresses to modifying
    the baseline configurations to incorporate more advanced Helm constructs. Finally,
    you will learn how to deploy a chart to a basic chart repository'
