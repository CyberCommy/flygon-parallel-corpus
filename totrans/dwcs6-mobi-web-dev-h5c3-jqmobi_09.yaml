- en: At this stage of our journey, we've explored the structuring of basic and more
    complex jQuery Mobile pages with Dreamweaver CS6\. What's missing? Style! We haven't
    yet customized fonts, font colors, backgrounds, and all the other things that
    we learned to do with CSS stylesheets in the early chapters of this book.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But normal CSS styling rules apply only in a very limited sense when we are
    styling jQuery Mobile pages. Why? Because jQuery Mobile pages rely on a centralized,
    and rather massive CSS stylesheet file. The file includes five sets of color scheme
    swatches. In this chapter, you'll learn to apply those color swatches in Dreamweaver
    CS6.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But five sets of color scheme swatches are not many. In order to seriously customize
    how jQuery Mobile pages look, it is necessary to alter the theme, which is another
    way of saying you have to customize the centrally distributed CSS stylesheet.
    In the latter half of this chapter, we'll walk through how to create customized
    CSS files, themes, using **ThemeRoller**, an online utility embraced by Adobe.

    clicking on the plus (**+**) icon to the right-hand side of the **BACKGROUND**

    by expanding the **Link Color** section of the swatch. Click on the plus (**+**)
    icon next to **Link Color**, and define colors for each link state. You can define
    text color (and shadow), background color, and border color for three button states.
