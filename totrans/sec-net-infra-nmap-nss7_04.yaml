    Nessus as a tool and its various components. These recipes will help us gain detailed
    knowledge of the post-installation steps to be performed in order to be able to
    configure Nessus to perform network scans of a varied nature.

    *Understanding Network Scanning Tools*. For a quick recap, the Nessus scan policy
    consists of various settings and content, which is to be used while performing
    a Network Vulnerability Scan or Compliance Audit. This scan can be created by
    any Nessus user and can be made available for other users who can then also perform
    a scan. These policies can be duplicated, imported, and exported based on the
    user requirements. The only limitation of the policy export is that host-specific
    data such as Nessus audit files and credential details cannot be exported. These
    policies are available as part of the resources menu mentioned on the home screen
    once the user logs in to the Nessus web console:'

- en: User management allows the administrator to create new users and manage their
    own account. This allows for the segregation of various scans to be performed,
    instead of having to use one single account to perform all of the scans. This
    is because Nessus also allows simultaneous login. One account with scans of different
    users makes it difficult for a user to identify his or her scan at a given point
    in time, even though they can be moved into different folders.
  prefs: []

- en: How to choose a Nessus scan template and policy
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Nessus allows a user to customize their scan to the lowest degree, even allowing
    them to filter the plugins which are to be used, and disable the plugins, which
    will not be used. Every scan is unique in its own way. For example, if a user
    wants to perform a credentialed scan, he/she cannot use the host discovery scan
    template to create a new policy. In order to perform a credentialed scan, the
    user has to select a basic network scan or an advanced scan which has a feature
    for the user to enter credentials to authenticate with the machine to be scanned.
    Thus, it is really important to choose an apt scan template before you create
    a policy and to choose an apt policy once you create different policies. The second
    option is to select a previously created template or to import an existing template,
    which can be used to perform a scan.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The user can also create a policy on the go, just by clicking New Scan and selecting
    an existing template. The only disadvantage of this approach is that you cannot
    save the policy or the scan template that's used with the custom settings. You
    will have to create a similar new policy or rescan it using the same host, which
    will create a history of scans. This creates complications in revisiting the scan
    for results. In this recipe, we will look into the scan templates that are available
    in the free version and the policies that can be created by the user.

- en: In order to perform a scan correctly, it is equally important to select an apt
    policy. This will help the user to obtain correct results and saves a lot of time
    when confirming and reporting the vulnerabilities. For example, if a user wants
    to know the open ports and he or she goes to perform an advanced scan, he/she
    will obtain results for configuration audit, patch audit, and many unnecessary
    plugins which were used in the scan. Instead, if the user had selected a basic
    network scan, all he/she would find would be open ports and a list of vulnerabilities
    affecting the services running on those hosts.

- en: From following the preceding recipes, a user should be able to understand the
    creation and selection of a policy. Once the policy has been decided upon, all
    the user needs to do is to identify the host to be scanned, select the policy,
    and click Scan. The general scan time for Nessus for a noncredential scan of a
    single host with few ports open will take a couple of minutes. As the number of
    hosts and ports keeps increasing, the time required for the scan also becomes
    high.

- en: It is always recommended to inform the stakeholders before performing a Nessus
    scan, as it would allow an overhead of incident investigation on whether an attack
    was performed on the host and also inform network admins as to whether network
    bandwidth utilization may be higher than it is normally.
