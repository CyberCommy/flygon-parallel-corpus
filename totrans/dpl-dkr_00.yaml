- en: Microservices and containers are here to stay, and in today's world Docker is
    emerging as the de facto standard for scalability. Deploying Docker into production
    is considered to be one of the major pain points of developing large-scale infrastructure
    and the documentation that you can find online leaves a lot to be desired. With
    this book, you will get exposure to the various tools, techniques, and workarounds
    available for the development and deployment of a Docker infrastructure in your
    own cloud, based on the author's real-world experiences of doing the same. You
    will learn everything you wanted to know to effectively scale your deployments
    globally and build a resilient and scalable containerized cloud platform for yourself.

    Just Another Buzzword*, examines what the current approaches are to deploying
    services and why containers, and Docker specifically, are eclipsing other forms
    of infrastructure deployment.'

    covers all the necessary steps to set up and run a small local service based on
    Docker. We will cover how to install Docker, run it, and get a quick overview
    of the Docker CLI. With that knowledge, we will write a basic Docker container
    and see how to run it locally.'

    covers how to take the knowledge from the previous chapter and use it to create
    and build additional of a database and an app server container, mirroring simple
    decomposed microservice deployments.'

    talks about scaling horizontally with multiple instances of the same container.
    We will cover service discovery, how to deploy one to make the scaling of a module
    transparent to the rest of the infrastructure, and its various pros and cons depending
    on the implementation, with a quick look into horizontal node scaling.'

    Persistent*, covers data persistence for your containers. We will cover node-local
    storage, transient storage, and persistent volumes and their intricacies. We will
    also spend a bit more time on Docker image layering and some pitfalls.'

    and their trade-offs will be covered here.'

    scale beyond your basic RESTful service needs. We will dig deep into the issues
    that you will find with default deployments and how to work around them with minimal
