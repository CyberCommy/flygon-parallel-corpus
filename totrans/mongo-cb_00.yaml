- en: MongoDB is a document-oriented, leading NoSQL database, which offers linear
    scalability, thus making it a good contender for high-volume, high-performance
    systems across all the business domains. It has an edge over the majority of NoSQL
    solutions for its ease of use, high performance, and rich features.

- en: This book provides detailed recipes that describe how to use the different features
    of MongoDB. The recipes cover topics ranging from setting up MongoDB, knowing
    its programming language API, and monitoring and administration, to some advanced
    topics such as cloud deployment, integration with Hadoop, and some open source
    and proprietary tools for MongoDB. The recipe format presents the information
    in a concise, actionable form; this lets you refer to the recipe to address and
    know the details of just the use case in hand without going through the entire
    book.

- en: '[Chapter 1](ch01.html "Chapter 1. Installing and Starting the Server"), *Installing
    and Starting the Server*, is all about starting MongoDB. It will demonstrate how
    to start the server in the standalone mode, as a replica set, and as a shard,
    with the provided start up options from the command line or configuration file.'

- en: '[Chapter 2](ch02.html "Chapter 2. Command-line Operations and Indexes"), *Command-line
    Operations and Indexes*, has simple recipes to perform CRUD operations in the
    Mongo shell and create various types of indexes in the shell.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 3](ch03.html "Chapter 3. Programming Language Drivers"), *Programming
    Language Drivers*, discusses about programming language APIs. Though Mongo supports
    a vast array of languages, we will look at how to use the drivers to connect to
    the MongoDB server from Java and Python programs only. This chapter also explores
    the MongoDB wire protocol used for communication between the server and programming
    language clients.'

- en: '[Chapter 4](ch04.html "Chapter 4. Administration"), *Administration*, contains
    many recipes for administration or your MongoDB deployment. This chapter covers
    a lot of frequently used administrative tasks such as viewing the stats of the
    collections and database, viewing and killing long-running operations and other
    replica sets, and sharding-related administration.'

- en: '[Chapter 5](ch05.html "Chapter 5. Advanced Operations"), *Advanced Operations*,
    is an extension of [Chapter 2](ch02.html "Chapter 2. Command-line Operations and
    Indexes"), *Command-line Operations and Indexes*. We will look at some of the
    slightly advanced features such as implementing server-side scripts, geospatial
    search, GridFS, full text search, and how to integrate MongoDB with an external
    full text search engine.'

- en: '[Chapter 6](ch06.html "Chapter 6. Monitoring and Backups"), *Monitoring and
    Backups*, tells you all about administration and some basic monitoring. However,
    MongoDB provides a state-of-the-art monitoring and real-time backup service, MongoDB
    Monitoring Service (MMS). In this chapter, we will look at some recipes around
    monitoring and backup using MMS.'

- en: '[Chapter 7](ch07.html "Chapter 7. Deploying MongoDB on the Cloud"), *Deploying
    MongoDB on the Cloud*, covers recipes that use MongoDB service providers for cloud
    deployment. We will set up our own MongoDB server on the AWS cloud as well as
    run MongoDB in Docker containers.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 8](ch08.html "Chapter 8. Integration with Hadoop"), *Integration with
    Hadoop*, covers recipes to integrate MongoDB with Hadoop to use the Hadoop MapReduce
    API in order to run MapReduce jobs on the data residing in MongoDB data files
    and write the results to them. We will also see how to use AWS EMR to run our
    MapReduce jobs on the cloud using Amazon''s Hadoop cluster, EMR, with the mongo-hadoop
    connector.'

- en: '[Chapter 9](ch09.html "Chapter 9. Open Source and Proprietary Tools"), *Open
    Source and Proprietary Tools*, is about using frameworks and products built around
    MongoDB to improve a developer''s productivity or about simplifying some of the
    day-to-day jobs using Mongo. Unless explicitly mentioned, the products/frameworks
    that we will be looking at in this chapter are open source.'

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The version of MongoDB used to try out the recipes is 3.0.2\. The recipes are
    good for version 2.6.*x* as well. In case of some special feature specific to
    version 2.6.*x*, it would be explicitly mentioned in the recipe. Unless explicitly
    mentioned, all commands should be executed on Ubuntu Linux.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The samples where Java programming was involved were tested and run on Java
    Version 1.7, and Python code was run using Python v2.7 (compatible with Python
    3). For MongoDB drivers, you can choose to use the latest available version.

- en: These are pretty common types of software, and their minimum versions are used
    across different recipes. All the recipes in this book will mention the required
    software to complete it and their respective versions. Some recipes need to be
    tested on a Windows system, while some on Linux.
