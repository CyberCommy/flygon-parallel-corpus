- en: Web applications have come a long way since the 90s, where static HTML pages
    were delivered to the client. In those days, web pages had a strict client-server
    model, where much of the processing was done on the server and the client only
    presented the information with little to no interaction. Such information was
    only accessible through desktop computers on very slow networks.

- en: Those days have passed, and we are now connected in ways that were impossible
    before. From cellphones that can still make calls on the subway, to tablets presenting
    the latest article from your favorite newspaper 30,000 feet in the air; we are
    now in a digital age where information is easily accessible through innovative
    technologies. Yet, we still struggle to create a seamless interaction between
    technology and the physical world.

    and have the ability to monitor our vital signals, it is still up to us to make
    applications that will change the world. The hard work that goes into creating
    these applications usually requires large teams, complex business roles, and costly
    expenses.

- en: For a brief period of time, developing these applications presented a challenge
    to many entrepreneurs who were looking to drive change. A staggered mobile market,
    which continues to this day, contributed to limited development resources. What
    we saw was an increase in the advancement of these technologies, but very few
    people who understood or were even interested in learning all the languages felt
    the necessity to create a cross-platform application.

- en: However, it was only a matter of time until a single platform would arrive and
    change the world forever. HTML5, and its implementation across devices, helped
    drive the force necessary to deliver a platform that allowed developers to innovate
    and change the world. Leveraging this technology in our applications allows us
    to push the limit of the hardware while creating something that many users can
    enjoy, no matter what device they prefer to use.

- en: Over the years, I have come to realize that device agnostic applications will
    become the norm. We have seen competitors adopt these standards with little to
    no impact on their success; in fact, it can be argued that it has done the opposite.
    For these reasons, this book was written to provide you with the techniques to
    create applications, based on open standards, and for the successful creation
    of device agnostic software.
