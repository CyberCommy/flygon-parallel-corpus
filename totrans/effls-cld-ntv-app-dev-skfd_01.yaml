- en: In this section, we will describe the pain and suffering of developing an application
    with Kubernetes. There are several manual touchpoints in developing a Kubernetes
    application locally, and it decreases the productivity of a developer. The focus
    should be on writing code and adding more features to the product rather than
    worrying about replicating infrastructure on your workstation to debug an issue
    or test a feature. Engineers at Google described this as an infinite loop of pain
    and suffering. We will introduce you to Skaffold and how it can help you automate
    the build, push, and deploy workflow for applications running on Kubernetes.
