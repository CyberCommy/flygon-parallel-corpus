    easy to design a program's **graphical user interface** (**GUI **) using the tools
    provided by Qt. Throughout this book, we will try and create a single project
    that involves many different components and modules of Qt. We will go through
    each section of the project in each chapter, so that you will eventually be able
    to grasp the entire Qt Framework and at the same time complete demo projects,
    which is a really valuable item to add to your portfolio. You can find all the
    source code at [https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Hands-On-GUI-Programming-with-C-QT5](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Hands-On-GUI-Programming-with-C-QT5).

    works hand-in-hand with several different tools that come with Qt, such as the
    script editor, compiler, debugger, profiler, and UI editor. The UI editor, which
    you can see in the preceding screenshot, is called Qt Designer. Qt Designer is
    the perfect tool for designers to design their program's UI without writing any
    code. This is because Qt Designer adopted the **WYSIWYG** (**what you see is what
    you get**) approach by providing an accurate visual representation of the final
    result, which means whatever you design with Qt Designer will turn out exactly
    the same when the program is compiled and run. Do note that each tool that comes
    with Qt can, in fact, be run individually, but if you're a beginner or just doing
    a simple project, it's recommended to just use the Qt Creator, which connects
    all those tools together in one interface.

    and are really powerful. Qt programs don't typically lay elements out using the
    fixed position because layouts allow dialogs and windows to be dynamically resized
    in a sensible manner while handling a varying length of text when it's localized
    in different languages. If you don't make use of layouts in your Qt programs,
    its UI may very look very different on different computers or devices, which in

- en: Lastly, we want to have a nice-looking background, and we can do this by attaching
    a background image. To do so, we first need to import the image into Qt's resource
    system. Go to File | New File or Project...Then, select Qt under the Files and
    Classes category. After that, pick the Qt Resource File and click the Choose...
    button. The Qt resource system is a platform-independent mechanism for storing
    binary files in the application's executable. You can basically store all of those
    important files here, such as icon images or language files, directly into your
    executable by using the Qt resource file. These important files will be directly
    embedded into your program during the compilation process.

    and follow this by clicking the Finish button. Now, you will see a new resource
    file being created, which I named `resource.qrc`:'

    whether the final outcome looks the same, as intended. There are a lot more things
    to tweak in order to make it look truly professional, but so far it's looking
    pretty great!

    it include all the common widgets but it also has handy stuff like the layout
    and spacer, which makes our program run perfectly fine on different types of monitors
    and screen sizes. Also, notice that we have successfully created a working application
    with a beautiful user interface without writing a single line of C++ code!
