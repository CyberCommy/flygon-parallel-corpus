    user and group accounts. First, we investigated the various directories from which
    the new user's home directories are populated. Next, we dealt with user account
    creation. Also, we looked at the various configuration files where the user passwords
    are kept. Finally, our focus was on the groups. We covered the steps for creating
    a group, and adding, removing, and assigning a password for a group.

    We will cover scheduling of tasks using various methods. We often work with various
    tasks on a daily basis, rather than having to run the tasks manually and repetitively
    over a period of time; it's good practice to implement some type of additional
    automation, and we will be looking at permissions regarding execution of tasks.

- en: In this chapter, we dealt with automation at the command line. We touched on
    the `at` utility, focusing on creating a job that runs once. Next, our focus was
    the usage of the `atq` utility and how it displays all scheduled jobs that the
    `at` utility will run. Also, we saw how to leverage an option with the `at` utility
    to enable us to view the job queue. Following this, we looked at the `atrm` utility,
    the primary focus being the ability to remove a scheduled job. In addition to
    this, we also saw the possibility of stopping a job by using the `at` command
    and passing an option. We then covered `cron` , focusing on the various `cron`
    directories; each plays a vital role in terms of automating tasks. Next, we worked
    with `crontab`; we saw the breakdown of the syntax, and we then created a custom
    entry in `crontab`. Following this, we worked with `anacron`. We saw the use case
    of `anacron` and how it complements `cron`. We then created our own custom entry
    and executed the jobs in order to gain a better understanding of `anacron`. Finally,
    we looked at restrictions in terms of automation; primarily, we looked at restricting
    access to the `at` and `cron` utilities.
