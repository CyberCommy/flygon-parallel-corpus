    store. It usually focuses on speed and scalability. NoSQL has been taking the
    web development world by storm for the past 7 years. Huge companies, such as Netflix
    and Google, announced that they were moving many of their services to NoSQL databases,
    and many smaller companies followed this.

    be the main focus. The focus on database design might seem odd in a book about
    Flask, but choosing the correct database for your application is arguably the
    most important decision while designing your technology stack. In the vast majority
    of web applications, the database is the bottleneck, so the database you pick
    will determine the overall speed of your app. A study conducted by Amazon showed
    that even a 100-ms delay caused a 1 percent reduction in sales, so speed should
    always be one of the main concerns of a web developer. Also, there is an abundance
    of horror stories in the programmer community of web developers about choosing
    a popular NoSQL database and then not really understanding what the database required
    in terms of administration. This leads to large amounts of data loss and crashes,
    which in turn means losing customers. All in all, it's no exaggeration to say
    that your choice of database for your application can be the difference between
    your app succeeding or failing.

    in a database. To make matters more confusing, NoSQL may also mean the databases
    that are relational but did not use SQL as a query language, for example, **RethinkDB**.
    The vast majority of NoSQL databases are not relational, unlike RDBMS, which means
    that they cannot perform operations such as `JOIN`. The lack of a `JOIN` operation
    is a trade-off because it allows faster reads and easier decentralization by spreading
    data across several servers or even separate data centers.

- en: A **key-value** NoSQL database acts much like a dictionary in Python. A single
    value is associated with one key and is accessed via that key. Also, like a Python
    dictionary, most key-value databases have the same read speed regardless of how
    many entries there are. Advanced programmers would know this as **O(1) reads**.
    In some key-value stores, only one key can be retrieved at a time, rather than
    multiple rows in traditional SQL databases. In most key-value stores, the content
    of the value is not *queryable*, but the keys are. Values are just binary blobs;
    they can be literally anything from a string to a movie file. However, some key-value
    stores give default types, such as strings, lists, sets, and dictionaries, while
    still giving the option of adding binary data.

- en: Because of their simplicity, key-value stores are typically very fast. However,
    their simplicity makes them unsuitable as the main database for most applications.
    As such, most key-value store use cases are storing simple objects that need to
    expire after a given amount of time. Two common examples of this pattern are storing
    user's session data and shopping cart data. Also, key-value stores are commonly
    used as caches for the application or for other databases. For example, results
    from a commonly run, or CPU-intensive, query or function are stored with the query
    or function name as a key. The application will check the cache in the key-value
    store before running the query on the database, thereby decreasing page load times
    and stress on the database. An example of this functionality will be shown in
    [Chapter 10](ch10.html "Chapter 10. Useful Flask Extensions"), *Useful Flask Extensions*.

    pairs called documents. These documents are schema-less, meaning no document must
    follow the structure of another document. Also, extra keys may be appended to
    the document after its creation. Most document stores store data in **JSON** (**JavaScript
    Object Notation**), a superset of JSON, or XML. For example, the following are
    two different post objects stored in JSON:'

    means that there are no type checks at the database level. There is nothing on
    the database to stop an integer from being entered into the title field of a post.
    Schema-less data is the most powerful feature of document stores and draws many
    to adopt one for their apps. However, it can also be considered very dangerous,
    as there is one less check stopping faulty or malformed data from getting into

    continue. First, in column family stores, data can only be selected via a single
    key or key range; there is no way to query the contents of the columns. To get
    around this, many programmers use an external search tool with their database,
    such as **Elasticsearch**, that stores the contents of columns in a searchable
    format and returns matching keys to be queried on the database. This limitation
    is why proper *schema* design is so crucial in column family stores, and must
    be carefully thought through before storing any data.
  id: totrans-30
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Second, data cannot be ordered by the content of the columns. Data can only
    be ordered by key, which is why the keys to the posts are integers. This allows
    the posts to be returned in the order in which they were entered. This was not
    a requirement for the user table because there is no need to sequentially order
    users.

    column is named a super column, which is a column that holds other columns. In
    this table, a super column is associated with our user key, which is holding an
    association of the position of a post to one post. Clever readers might ask why
    we wouldn't just store this association in our user table, much like how the problem
    would be solved in document stores. This is because regular columns and super
    columns cannot be held in the same table. You must choose one at the creation
    of each table.

    association table with our user key, use the returned list of associations to

  id: totrans-38

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If that query seems like a roundabout process to you that's because it is, and
    it is that way by design. The limiting nature of a column family store is what
    allows it to be so fast and handle so much data. Removing features such as searching
    by value and column name give column family stores the ability to handle hundreds
    of terabytes of data. It's not an exaggeration to say that SQLite is a more complex
    database for the programmer than a typical column family store.

    an arbitrary number of one-way relationships between the nodes, named **links**,

    joined. Otherwise, we could query for people who are in the same groups as a user,
    but the user doesn't know them. Queries in a graph store can also follow a large

    methods in place to ensure that the data entered into the database will not only
    be correct, but that data loss is practically nonexistent. These methods combine
    to form what is known as **ACID**, which stands for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation,
    and Durability. ACID is a set of rules for transactions that guarantee that the
    transaction is handled safely.
  id: totrans-56

    should not keep operating because the proceeding operations most likely require
    that the previous operations were successful.'

    follow the rules of each table. Such rules include type checks, user-defined constraints,

    to speed up writes, that the outcome of the transactions would be the same if
    they were run serially. This is mostly a rule for database programmers and not
    something that web developers need to worry about.

    never be lost, barring a hard drive failure after the transaction is accepted.
    If the database crashes or loses power, the durability principle requires that
    any data written before the problem occurred still be present when the server
    is backed up. This essentially means that all transactions must be written to
    the disk once they are accepted.

    stores, sacrifice consistency for availability. This means that they can handle
    many concurrent reads and writes, but those writes may be in conflict with one
    another. These databases promise "eventual consistency" rather than consistency
    checks on each write. In short, many NoSQL databases do not provide ACID transactions,
    or they are turned off by default. Once ACID checks are enabled, the speed of
    the database drops to near the performance of traditional databases. Every NoSQL
    database handles data safety differently, so it's important to read the documentation
    carefully before choosing one over another.

- en: The second feature that pulls people to NoSQL is its ability to handle unformatted
    data. Storing data in XML or JSON allows an arbitrary structure for each document.
    Applications that store user-designed data have benefited greatly from the adoption
    of NoSQL. For example, a video game that allows players to submit their custom
    levels to some central repository can now store the data in a queryable format
    rather than in a binary blob.

- en: The third feature that draws people to NoSQL is the ease of creating a cluster
    of databases working in tandem. Not having `JOIN`s or only accessing values via
    keys makes splitting the data across servers a rather trivial task when compared
    with an RDBMS. This is due to the fact that `JOIN`s requires a scan of the entire
    table, even if it is split across many different servers. `JOIN`s become even
    slower when documents or keys can be assigned to a server by an algorithm as simple
    as the starting character of its unique identifier. For example, everything that
    starts with the letters A-H is sent to server one, I-P to server two, and Q-Z
    to server three. This makes looking up the location of data for a connected client
    very fast.

  zh: 吸引人们使用NoSQL的第三个特性是轻松创建一组协同工作的数据库集群。没有`JOIN`或者只通过键访问值使得在多台服务器之间分割数据相对来说是一个相当简单的任务，与关系型数据库相比。这是因为`JOIN`需要扫描整个表，即使它分布在许多不同的服务器上。当文档或键可以通过简单的算法分配到服务器时，`JOIN`变得更慢，例如，可以根据其唯一标识符的起始字符将其分配到服务器。例如，以字母A-H开头的所有内容发送到服务器一，I-P发送到服务器二，Q-Z发送到服务器三。这使得查找连接客户端的数据位置非常快。

- en: So, each database has different uses. It was stated at the beginning of the
    section that the main problem when programmers choose a NoSQL database for their
    technology stack is that they choose it when an RDBMS would work just as well.
    This is born out of some common misconceptions. First, people try to use a relational
    mindset and data model and think that they will work just as well in a NoSQL database.
    People usually come to this misunderstanding because the marketing on websites
    for NoSQL databases is misleading and encourages users to drop their current database
    without considering if a nonrelational model would work for their project.

    are necessary to store a document in a collection. Documents are defined in a
    JSON superset named BSON, which stands for Binary JSON. BSON allows JSON to be

    also distinguishes between several different ways of storing numbers, such as
    32-bit integers and doubles.

    how simple it was to set up complex relationships and inheritance. In the next
