- en: Many businesses want to run their e-mail servers on Linux for greater control
    and flexibility of corporate communications, but getting started can be complicated.
    The attractiveness of a free-to-use and robust e-mail service running on Linux
    can be undermined by the apparent technical challenges involved. Some of the complexity
    arises from the fact that an e-mail server consists of several components that
    must be installed and configured separately, then integrated together.

    server. Unlike other approaches that deal with one component at a time, this book
    delivers a step-by-step approach across all the server components, leaving you
    with a complete working e-mail server for your small business network.

    explains the benefits and disadvantages of running your own e-mail server and
