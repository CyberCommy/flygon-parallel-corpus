- en: This section follows the creation of a single microservice across three chapters.
    It starts by presenting an individual REST service implemented in Python, continues
    with all the requisite steps to implement the service as a self-contained Docker
    container, and creates a pipeline to ensure that the service always complies with
    high quality standards.

- en: The first chapter of this section describes the implementation of a single service,
    following the example presented in the first section. It describes the API interface
    to be implemented and it uses Python to generate a full-fledged microservice,
    using tools such as Flask and SQLAlchemy to improve the ease of development. The
    service includes a testing strategy.

- en: The second chapter of this section shows how to encapsulate the microservice
    in a Docker container so that the code can be executed immutably through the software
    life cycle. Basic Docker usage, such as building and running containers, using
    environment variables, and how to execute testing, is introduced. The process
    of sharing containers incorporated into a public registry is also described.

- en: The third chapter of this section delves into checking automatically that any
    new code introduced in the container follows basic quality guidelines, including
    passing all the tests. It presents continuous integration practices and demonstrates
    how to create a pipeline in the cloud with Travis CI that will be integrated into
    a GitHub repository. How to push the resulting container automatically into a
    registry is also covered in this chapter.
