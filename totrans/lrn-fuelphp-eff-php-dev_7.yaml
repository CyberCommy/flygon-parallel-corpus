- en: As you have seen from the preceding chapters, FuelPHP provides a lot of features
    and is constantly evolving with new features and ways of working. It deals with
    time-consuming tasks, allowing us to concentrate on the more fun aspects of coding.
    Thanks to a large community of developers, we have a large selection of packages
    and modules to give us a head start on projects and laying the foundations for
    great applications and projects.

    the main documentation resides. As the framework is open source, the real hub
    of activity is the GitHub pages, which can be found at [https://github.com/fuel/](https://github.com/fuel/).

- en: Sometimes, we need to get a little extra help that isn't always covered in the
    documentation. For this, there are the main FuelPHP forums at [http://fuelphp.com/forums/](http://fuelphp.com/forums/).
    These are usually a great place to start when you need a little extra help. The
    forums are split into several groups, such as General, Packages, and Development.
    It's a great place to publicize your new packages or simply share what you have
    created.

    uses both Twitter and Facebook for this purpose.

    This is a great way of publicizing applications you've built, as they will often
    retweet you to their followers.

    of FuelPHP. I always believe that the best way to learn a new language or framework
    is to use it for a project or an idea.

- en: The FuelPHP Oil tool is a great way for quickly prototyping ideas to test or
    demonstrate. Think about the minimum viable product that can be built to test
    the idea. This will give you the momentum to get it started.
