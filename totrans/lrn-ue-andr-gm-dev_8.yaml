    install UE4, how to create a project, how to create materials, adding/importing/migrating
    assets from other projects, scripting with Blueprints, and so on. Hopefully by
    now, you know enough about UE4 to get started. The next step is taking what you
    have learned, and to keep practicing.

    and download a project file, you can open it and check it out. Everything related
    to that feature is already set up for you, and you can see for yourself how everything
