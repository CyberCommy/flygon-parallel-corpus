    How to do this depends on the version control system you choose (it may be dictated
    by your organization, for example, or you may have a personal preference from
    working on past projects), and how you do this differs from system to system,
    so we won't go into it here. But, you need to have a repository to store the versions
    of your source code, and have the appropriate version control software installed
    on your workstation with the appropriate directories containing the version control
    binaries in your system's `PATH` environment variable, so that Qt Creator can
    find them. It's important that you access the version control commands from your
