- en: JavaScript is a quirky little language that was written by Brendan Eich when
    he was working at Netscape around 1995\. It was the first browser-based scripting
    language and ran only in Netscape Navigator at the time, but it eventually found
    its way into most other web browsers. Back then, web pages consisted almost entirely
    of static markup. JavaScript (initially named LiveScript) emerged around the need
    to make pages dynamic and to bring the power of a full scripting language to browser
    developers.

- en: A lot of the design decisions of the language were driven by the need of simplicity
    and ease of use, although at the time, some were made for pure marketing reasons
    at Netscape. The name "JavaScript" was chosen to associate it with Java from Sun
    Microsystems, despite the fact that Sun really had nothing to do with it and that
    it's conceptually quite different from its namesake.

- en: Except in one way, that is, most of its syntax was borrowed from Java, and also
    C and C++, so as to be familiar to the programmers coming from these languages.
    But despite looking similar, it is in fact a very different beast under the hood
    and shares characteristics with the more exotic languages such as Self, Scheme,
    and Smalltalk. Among these are dynamic typing, prototypical inheritance, first
    class functions, and closures.

- en: So we ended up with a language that looked a lot like some of the mainstream
    languages at the time and could be coaxed into acting a lot like them, but with
    quite different central ideas. This has caused it to be very misunderstood for
    many years. A lot of programmers never saw it as being a "serious" programming
    language and thus didn't apply a lot of the best development practices built up
    over decades when it came to writing browser code.

- en: Those who did delve further into the language were sure to find a lot of strangeness.
    Eich himself admitted that the language was prototyped within about 10 days, and
    even though what he came up with was impressive, JavaScript isn't without (many)
    warts. These too didn't really help to raise its profile.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Despite all these issues, JavaScript still became one of the most widely used
    programming languages in the world, if not merely because of the explosion of
    the Internet and the spread of web browsers. Support across a multitude of browsers
    would seem to be a great thing, but it also caused havoc because of differences
    in implementations, both in the language and the DOM.

- en: Around 2005, the term AJAX was coined to describe a style of JavaScript programming
    that was made possible by the introduction of the `XMLHTTPRequest` object in browsers.
    This meant that developers could write client-side code that could communicate
    with the server using HTTP directly, and update page elements without reloading
    the page. This was really a turning point in the history of the language. All
    of a sudden, it was being used in "serious" web applications, and people began
    to see the language in a different light.

- en: In 2006, John Resig released jQuery to the world. It was designed to simplify
    client-side scripting, DOM manipulation, and AJAX, as well as to abstract away
    many of the inconsistencies across browsers. It became an essential tool for many
    JavaScript programmers. To date, it is used on 55 percent of the top 10, 000 websites
    in the world.

- en: In 2009, Ryan Dahl created Node.js, an event-driven network application framework
    written on top of the Google V8 JavaScript engine. It quickly became very popular,
    especially for writing web server applications. A big factor in its success has
    been the fact that you could now write JavaScript on the server, as well as in
    the browser. An elaborate and distinguished community has sprung up around the
    framework, and at present the future of Node.js is looking very bright.

- en: Early in 2010, Jeremy Ashkenas created CoffeeScript, a language that compiles
    to JavaScript. Its goal is to create cleaner, more concise, and more idiomatic
    JavaScript and to make it easier to use the better features and patterns of the
    language. It does away with a lot of the syntactic cruft of JavaScript, reducing
    the line noise and generally creating much shorter and clearer code.

- en: Influenced by languages such as Ruby, Python, and Haskell, it borrows some of
    the powerful and interesting features of these languages. Although it can look
    quite different, the CoffeeScript code generally maps to its generated JavaScript
    pretty closely. It has grown to be an overnight success, quickly being adopted
    by the Node.js community as well as being included in Ruby on Rails 3.1.

- en: Brendan Eich has also expressed his admiration for CoffeeScript, and has used
    it as an example of some of the things he would like to see in the future versions
    of JavaScript.

- en: This book serves as an introduction to the language as well as a motivation
    for why you should write CoffeeScript instead of JavaScript wherever you can.
    It also then explores using CoffeeScript in the browser using jQuery and Ruby
    on Rails, as well as on the server using Node.js.
