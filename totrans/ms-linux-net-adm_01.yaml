- en: Welcome to the world of Linux networking! This book will be your guide to perfecting
    your Linux network management skills. In this chapter, we will go over what's
    needed to get your environment up and running. We'll talk about several Linux
    distributions that are of interest to enterprise networking, the things to keep
    in mind while setting up an environment in your home or office so you can follow
    along with this book, and some best practices for setting up a few Linux installations
    that we'll use throughout this book. Basically, we'll lay the groundwork that
    you'll use to develop your skills.

    While the core components typically remain the same throughout the years (such
    as the **TCP/IP** protocol), how these services are managed have evolved in each
    generation, such as the rise of **systemd**. Linux is definitely exciting.

    comfortable setting up a distribution or two on a physical or **virtual machine**,

    to install a few distributions of interest for the exercises in this book and

    While practicing networking concepts, it's a good idea to have as many nodes as
    possible, so you can test how your configuration changes, will affect your environment.
    If you are already comfortable installing Linux, feel free to set up some nodes
    and then I'll meet you in the next chapter.

- en: There are over a hundred distributions of Linux in existence today. These include
    distributions geared specifically toward workstations or servers (or even both)
    and specialist distributions, which solve a specific task, such as Kali, Mythbuntu,
    and Clonezilla. Naturally, the first question one might have when studying a concept
    such as network administration is which distributions to start with.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Let's not focus on any one distribution. In the enterprise, no two data centers
    are same. Some organizations that utilize Linux might standardize on a specific
    distribution set (for example, Ubuntu and Ubuntu Server) though it's far more
    common to see a mix of one or more distributions in use. Distributions such as
    **SUSE Enterprise Linux**, **Red Hat Enterprise Linux**, **Ubuntu Server**, **CentOS**,
    and **Debian** are extremely common among servers within Linux-based networks.
    In my experience, I've seen Debian (as well as its derivatives) and Red Hat-based
    distributions in use most often.
  prefs: []

- en: You are encouraged to experiment and mix up whichever distributions you might
    favor. There are many candidates, and websites such as [www.distrowatch.com](http://www.distrowatch.com)
    would give you a list of possibilities. Specifically for the sake of the examples
    in this book, CentOS and Debian are recommended for your use. In fact, these two
    distributions are wonderful places to start. You'll get a taste for two different
    forms of package management (**rpm** and **deb** packages) and familiarize yourself
    with two of the most popular distributions. Regarding Debian, quite a few distributions
    are based on it (**Ubuntu**, **Linux Mint**, and others). By learning how to manage
    a Debian installation, much of that knowledge would be transferable to other distributions
    should you consider switching. The same can be said about CentOS, which is based
    on Red Hat. Red Hat is a very popular distribution and since CentOS is created
    from its source, you're essentially learning it as well. While **Fedora** is more
    bleeding-edge than Red Hat or CentOS, much of the knowledge will be useful there
    as well; Fedora is popular as a workstation distribution.

    an instruction is specific to a particular distribution, I will let you know.
    Having a CentOS and Debian installation will suit you for the purposes of this
    book, but feel free to experiment. As far as individual versions of these distributions
    are concerned, both CentOS 7 and Debian 8 were used. Install these in your environment
    or home lab.

- en: Seeing a section on virtual machines in a networking book may come as somewhat
    of a surprise. To be fair, it certainly is out of place. In addition to being
    an important enterprise platform, **virtualization** can also be an invaluable
    learning tool. In real networks, a technician may test a service in a virtual
    machine before rolling it out to the environment. For example, a new **DNS** server
    may begin life as a **VM**, and then once it is tested and proven, moved into
    an environment for use by the organization. One benefit of this approach is that
    you can take several snapshots as you develop the solution, and should you mess
    up and ruin it, you can just restore the snapshot and begin from a known-working
    state.

- en: As far as mastering our Linux networking skills are concerned, virtual machines
    allow you to test how a procedure differs from one distribution to another. It's
    easy to bring up a virtual machine, and it's even easier to trash it. If you're
    limited by physical hardware, then virtual machines may offer you a chance to
    build a small virtual network to practice on. Of course, the trade-off with virtual
    machines is how much RAM they use. However, without a GUI, most Linux distributions
    will run quite comfortably with just 512 MB RAM. Nowadays, quite a few computers
    ship with 8 GB or even 16 GB RAM, so you should be able to run several VMs on
    even the budget computers available today.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To be fair, using virtual machines for purposes of practice and study isn't
    always ideal. In fact, when studying networking, physical equipment is usually
    preferred. While you can certainly practice setting up and serving a web page
    via Apache running in a VM, you wouldn't be able to practice racking switches
    and routers in such an environment. Whenever possible, try to use physical equipment.
    However, virtual machines offer a unique chance for you to create a small army
    of nodes to maintain on your network.

    and waiting for a shiny new Linux install. Depending on what you have at your
    disposal, you may use all physical machines or a mix of physical and virtual.
    In this book, no assumptions are made about your inventory. The name of the game
    is to manage nodes, so set up as many as possible.

- en: In this book, **VirtualBox** is discussed. However, it's by no means the only
    solution for creating virtual machines. There are other solutions as well, such
    as **KVM**, **Xen**, **VMware** and others. VirtualBox has the benefit of being
    free, open source, and cross-platform (it's available for Linux, Mac OS X, and
    Windows), so there's a good chance it will work in your environment. In most cases,
    it's even easier to set up than KVM or Xen (but perhaps not nearly as cool). You
    don't have to use VirtualBox (or even VMs at all, for that matter) in order to
    follow along with this book. Use whatever solution you prefer. In this book, I
    try not to limit the instructions to any one specific solution, so the content
    works for as many people as possible.

    repositories. Unfortunately, depending on the version of your distribution, the
    version of VirtualBox that may be included is very likely to be out of date. For

    distributions such as Arch are more likely to contain the latest and best.

    This means that it is more stable in quite a few cases, though it may not interest
