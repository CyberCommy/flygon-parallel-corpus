- en: Geoprocessing refers to the automation and chaining of GIS operations in a logical
    fashion to accomplish some sort of GIS task. For example, you may want to buffer
    a stream layer and then clip a vegetation layer to this newly created buffer.
    A model can be built in ArcGIS for Desktop and run in an automated fashion from
    either a desktop environment or via a centralized server accessed through a web
    application. Any tool found in ArcToolbox, whether a built-in tool for your ArcGIS
    license level or a custom tool that you've built, can be used in a model and chained
    together with other tools. This chapter examines how you can access these geoprocessing
    tasks through the ArcGIS API for JavaScript.

    the service. This includes the execution type that can be either synchronous or
    asynchronous. In the case of the service seen in the following screenshot, the
    **PopulationSummary** service is a synchronous task, which indicates that the
    application will wait for the results to be returned. This type of execution is
    typically used with tasks that execute quickly. Asynchronous tasks are submitted
    as a job and then the application can continue to function while the geoprocessing
    service is doing its work. When the task is complete, it notifies your application
    that the processing is complete and the results are ready.

- en: 'The `Geoprocessor` class in the ArcGIS API for JavaScript represents a GP task
    resource, which is a single task in a geoprocessing service. Input parameters
    are passed into the `Geoprocessor` class through a call to either `Geoprocessor.execute()`
    or `Geoprocessor.submitJob()`. We''ll discuss the difference between these two
    calls later. After executing the geoprocessing task, the results are returned
    to the `Geoprocessor` object, where they are processed by a callback function.
    Creating an instance of the `Geoprocessor` class simply requires you to pass in
    the URL that points to the geoprocessing service exposed by ArcGIS Server. It
    does require you to import `esri/tasks/gp`. The following code example shows you

- en: Once you have an understanding of the geoprocessing models and tools available
    to you for an ArcGIS Server instance as well as the input and output parameters,
    you can begin writing the code that will execute the task. Geoprocessing jobs
    are submitted to ArcGIS Server for either synchronous or asynchronous execution.
    A synchronous execution implies that the client calls for execution of the task
    and then waits for the result before continuing with the application code. In
    an asynchronous execution, the client submits a job, continues to run other functions,
    and checks back later for completion of the job. By default, the client checks
    back for completion every second until the job is finished. The service page tells
    you how to submit your job for each geoprocessing task. Simply look for the execution
    type on the service page. The execution type is set when the model is published
    as a service. As a developer, you don't have any control over the type after it
    has been published.

- en: Synchronous tasks require your application code to submit a job and wait for
    a response before continuing. Because your end users must wait for the results
    to be returned before continuing to interact with your application, this type
    of task should only be used with tasks that return data very quickly. If a task
    takes more than just a few seconds, it should be defined as asynchronous instead
    of synchronous. Users quickly become frustrated with applications when data is
    returned within a very short period of time.

    parameters and supplied callback function. The callback function is executed when
    the geoprocessing task returns the results of the job that was submitted. These
    results are stored in an array of `ParameterValue`.

- en: Asynchronous tasks require you to submit a job, continue working on other functions
    while waiting for the process to finish, and then check back in with ArcGIS Server
    on a periodic basis to retrieve the results after completion. The advantage of
    an asynchronous task is that it doesn't force your end users to wait for the results.
    Instead, the task is submitted and your end users continue to interact with the
    application until the task has finished processing. When processing is complete,
    a callback function is triggered in your application and you can handle the results
    that are returned.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The `Geoprocessor.submitJob()` method is used to submit a job to the geoprocessing
    task. You will need to supply input parameters, a callback function, and a status
    callback function. The status callback function executes each time your application
    checks back for the results. By default, the status is checked once per second.
    However, this interval can be changed using the `Geoprocessor.setUpdateDelay()`
    method. Each time the status is checked, a `JobInfo` object is returned and contains
    information indicating the status of the job. When `JobInfo.jobStatus` is set
    to `STATUS_SUCCEEDED`, the complete callback function is called.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A visual diagram of the process flow that occurs on asynchronous tasks is provided
    in the following figure and might help reinforce how these types of tasks operate.
    Input parameters are created and input to the `Geoprocessor` object, which uses
    these parameters to submit a geoprocessing job to ArcGIS Server. The `Geoprocessor`
    object then executes the `statusCallback()` function at regular intervals. This
    function checks with the geoprocessing service to see if the job is finished.
    A `JobInfo` object is returned and contains a status indicator, indicating its
    completion status. This process continues until the job is completed, at which
    time a complete callback function is called and which passes the results of the
    job.

- en: ArcGIS Server can expose geoprocessing services such as models and tools, which
    your application can access. These tools are run on ArcGIS Server due to their
    computationally intensive nature and need for ArcGIS software. Jobs are submitted
    to the server through your application and the results are returned after the
    task is complete. Geoprocessing tasks can be synchronous or asynchronous and are
    configured to run as one of these types by an ArcGIS Server administrator. As
    an application programmer, it is important for you to understand what type of
    geoprocessing service you are accessing as the method call that you make to the
    service depends upon this information. In addition, to know whether a task is
    synchronous or asynchronous, you also need to know the URL of the geoprocessing
    model or tool as well as the input and output parameters. In the next chapter,
    you will learn how to add data and maps from ArcGIS Online to your application.
