- en: In February 2017, I delivered a talk on Isomorphic Go at GopherCon India. Isomorphic
    Go is the methodology to create isomorphic web applications using the Go programming
    language. Isomorphic web application architecture promotes an enhanced user experience
    along with greater search engine discoverability. My talk on Isomorphic Go was
    well received and a group of full-stack engineers reached out to me afterwards.

- en: The engineers I met with expressed frustration at the complexity involved in
    having to maintain full-stack web application codebases. They lamented on having
    to juggle between two distinctly different programming languages, Go on the back-end
    and JavaScript on the front-end. Whenever they had to develop solutions with JavaScript,
    they longed for the simplicity in syntax, the robust standard library, the concurrency
    constructs, and the type safety that comes with Go, out of the box.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The message that they were conveying to me was loud and clear. They yearned
    for the ability to create full-stack web applications exclusively in Go. The proposition
    of being able to have a single unified Go codebase where developers could code
    in Go on both the front-end and back-end was an alluring one indeed.

- en: I created two action items for myself as a result of the feedback that I gathered
    from the conference. First, there needed to be a demonstration of the capabilities
    of an Isomorphic Go web application. Second, there needed to be a detailed explanation
    of all the major concepts behind Isomorphic Go.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The first action item, the demonstration of Isomorphic Go, became the genesis
    of the Isomorphic Go and UX toolkit open source projects—at the time of writing,
    these are the most advanced technologies for creating isomorphic web applications
    in Go. The first isomorphic web application to be created in Go is the IGWEB demo
    (available at [http://igweb.kamesh.com](http://igweb.kamesh.com)), which is the
    web application that is featured in this book.

- en: The second action item, the explanation of major Isomorphic Go concepts, manifested
    itself as this book. After watching my talk on Isomorphic Go, Packt Publishing
    reached out to me with an opportunity to write this book, which I gladly accepted.
    It was truly an exhilarating experience being able to write a book about an emerging
    technology that I was extremely passionate about.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Writing this book provided me the opportunity to present ideas and concepts
    that had never been covered previously in the realm of Go programming, such as
    in-memory template sets, end-to-end routing, isomorphic handoff, isomorphic web
    forms, real-time web application functionality, reusable components with Go, writing
    end-to-end automated tests that exercised client-side functionality, and the deployment
    of an isomorphic web application written in Go.

- en: The extensive depth of this book's coverage ensured that I fulfilled an important
    responsibility to you, the reader, that I provided high value for your investment.
    This is especially significant since this happens to be the first and only book
    on Isomorphic Go.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book focuses on teaching you how to create an Isomorphic Go web application
    from the ground up. This book is a journey starting out with presenting the advantages
    of creating an isomorphic web application with Go, and ending with the deployment
    of a multi-container Isomorphic Go web application to the cloud.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book addresses readers who have had prior experience with the Go programming
    language and understand the language's essential concepts. It is also assumed
    that the reader has had prior experience with basic web development. No previous
    knowledge of isomorphic web application development is required. Since this book
    follows an idiomatic approach using Go, it is not necessary that the reader should
    have had prior experience using JavaScript or any tools or libraries within the
    JavaScript ecosystem.
