- en: Modern C++ allows you to write high-performing applications in a high-level
    language without sacrificing readability and maintainability. There's more to
    software architecture than just language, though. We're going to show you how
    to design and build applications that are robust and scalable and that perform
    well.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Complete with step-by-step explanations of essential concepts, practical examples,
    and self-assessment questions, you will begin by understanding the importance
    of architecture, looking at a case study of an actual application.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You'll learn how to use established design patterns at the level of a single
    application, exploring how to make your applications robust, secure, performant,
    and maintainable. You'll then build higher-level services that connect multiple
    single applications using patterns such as service-oriented architecture, microservices,
    containers, and serverless technology.

- en: The code examples in this book are mostly written for GCC 10\. They should work
    with Clang or Microsoft Visual C++ as well, though certain features from C++20
    may be missing in older versions of the compilers. To get a development environment
    as close to the authors' as possible, we advise you to use Nix ([https://nixos.org/download.html](https://nixos.org/download.html))
    and direnv ([https://direnv.net/](https://direnv.net/)) in a Linux-like environment.
    These two tools should configure the compilers and supporting packages for you
    if you run `direnv allow` in a directory containing examples.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Without Nix and direnv, we can't guarantee that the examples will work correctly.
    If you're on macOS, Nix should work just fine. If you're on Windows, the Windows
    Subsystem for Linux 2 is a great way to have a Linux development environment with
    Nix.
