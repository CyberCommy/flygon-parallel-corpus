- en: Nowadays exists tons of JavaScript libraries, frameworks, and tools for Web
    development. However, we should evaluate each technology to see if it fits for
    our project requirements. That's why I want to introduce to you React, one of
    the most powerful libraries to create dynamic UIs. Right now is the most popular
    library (not a framework) made by Facebook. I have worked with others JS frameworks
    such as AngularJS (also the new versions Angular 2, 4, 5), Backbone.js, Ember,
    and Vue.js in different projects but I can tell you that using React I enjoy more
    to developing new Web applications.

    we get a powerful frontend architecture that makes sense not only to experienced
    developers but also to those who're just starting their frontend journey.

    is a JavaScript library (MIT License) made by Facebook to create interactive UIs.
    It''s used to create dynamic and reusable components. The most powerful thing
    about React is that can be used in the client, server, mobile applications and
    even VR applications.'

    is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps. That means Redux can be
    used with vanilla JavaScript or frameworks/libraries such as Angular and jQuery.
    Redux is mainly a library responsible for issuing state updates and responses
    to actions.'

    applications because it is easy to create an API and its performance is better
    than technologies such as Java, PHP, and Ruby. Usually, the most popular way to
    use Node.js is by using a framework called Express.'

    is an open source (MIT license) created by Facebook. The main difference with

    versions, you must have a configuration file, but of course, if you need to customize
    Webpack 4 to your project needs, you can still create a configuration file which
    will be way easier to configure.'

    if you don''t care too much about SEO. Currently, the Googlebot supports Client
    Side Rendering (CSR), and it can index our site in Google, but if you care about
    SEO and you are worried about improving the SEO on others Search Engines like
    Yahoo, Bing or DuckDuckGo then using Server Side Rendering (SSR) is the way to
    go.'

    and debugging are very important for any project that wants to have the best quality.
    Unfortunately, many developers do not care about testing (unit tests) because
    they think that will reduce the speed of the development and some of them leave
    it until the end of the project. In my personal experience, I can say that testing
    since the beginning of the project will save you time because at the end you will
    have fewer bugs to fix.'

    Native, *React Native is a framework for building mobile apps using JavaScript
    and React. Many people think that with React Native you make some "mobile web
    app" or a "hybrid app" (like Ionic, PhoneGap or Sencha) but you build a native
    app because React Native converts your React code to Java for Android and Objective-C
    for iOS apps.'
