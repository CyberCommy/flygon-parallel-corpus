- en: Nowadays exists tons of JavaScript libraries, frameworks, and tools for Web
    development. However, we should evaluate each technology to see if it fits for
    our project requirements. That's why I want to introduce to you React, one of
    the most powerful libraries to create dynamic UIs. Right now is the most popular
    library (not a framework) made by Facebook. I have worked with others JS frameworks
    such as AngularJS (also the new versions Angular 2, 4, 5), Backbone.js, Ember,
    and Vue.js in different projects but I can tell you that using React I enjoy more
    to developing new Web applications.

    we get a powerful frontend architecture that makes sense not only to experienced
    developers but also to those who're just starting their frontend journey.

    and debugging are very important for any project that wants to have the best quality.
    Unfortunately, many developers do not care about testing (unit tests) because
    they think that will reduce the speed of the development and some of them leave
    it until the end of the project. In my personal experience, I can say that testing
    since the beginning of the project will save you time because at the end you will
    have fewer bugs to fix.'

    and React. Many people think that with React Native you make some "mobile web

    app because React Native converts your React code to Java for Android and Objective-C
    for iOS apps.'
