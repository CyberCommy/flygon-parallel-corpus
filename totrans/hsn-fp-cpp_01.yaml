- en: In this section, we will learn about the basic building blocks of functional
    programming and how to use them in C++. First, we will look at what functional
    programming is and how it is different from and similar to **object-oriented programming**
    (**OOP**). Then, we will dive into the fundamental idea of immutability and learn
    how to write pure functions in C++—that is, functions that don't change state.
    We will then learn how to use lambdas and how to write pure functions using them.

    In functional programming, functions are data, so we can pass them around and
    make operations with them. We will learn about partial application and currying,
    two fundamental and closely-related operations. We will also see how to compose
    functions. These operations will take us from simple functions to very complex
    ones with just a few lines of plumbing code.
