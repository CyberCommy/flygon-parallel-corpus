- en: During the preparation phase of a network penetration test, it's essential to
    understand the objective of security testing on the target's systems and/or network
    infrastructure. Prior to launching any sort of attack simulation, it's important
    to be an anonymous user (or pretend to be a legitimate user) on the network by
    spoofing the MAC address of your device and configuring your wireless network
    adapter to monitor and capture wireless traffic on an IEEE 802.11 wireless network.

    security auditing (penetration testing) on network security appliances, devices,
    and systems within the internal network of a target organization. In this chapter,
    you will learn about the various modes that can be configured on a wireless adapter
    in Kali Linux, how to spoof your MAC address, and how to capture packets on a
    wireless network.

    on a target's network infrastructure. This type of penetration test can be done
    either from outside the organization (external testing) or from the inside (internal
    testing). As a penetration tester, I would definitely recommend performing both

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this section, we are going to focus on the data link layer (layer 2) of the
    OSI model. The data link layer is responsible for moving data between the software
    applications on devices to the physical layer of a network. This is done by the
    NIC. Additionally, before the data is placed on the physical layer, the data layer
    inserts the physical address of the NIC, that is, the **media access control**
    (**MAC**) address, into the frame. This address is sometimes referred to as the
    **burned-in address** (**BIA**).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The MAC address of a device is 48 bits in length and is written in hexadecimal
    format; therefore, each character ranges between 0-9 and A-F. The first 24 bits
    are known as the **organizationally unique identifier** (**OUI**) and are assigned
    by the **Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers** (**IEEE**) to vendors
    and manufacturers. By having knowledge of the first 24 bits of any valid MAC address,
    you can determine the vendor/manufacturer of the NIC and/or device. The last 24
    bits are unique and assigned by the vendor, thereby creating a unique MAC address
    for each device.
