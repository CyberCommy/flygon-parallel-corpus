    system. It follows a set of core principles that define its philosophy and guide
    its development. Here are some of the key principles of Linux:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Open Source: Linux is built on the principle of open-source software, which
    means that its source code is freely available to the public. This allows users
    to study, modify, and distribute the code, promoting collaboration and transparency.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Free Redistribution: Linux can be freely distributed, copied, and shared with
    others. This principle ensures that anyone can access and use Linux without any
    restrictions or licensing fees. It also encourages the growth and widespread adoption
    of the operating system.'

- en: 'Modularity: Linux adopts a modular design approach, where components are developed
    independently and can be easily integrated into the operating system. This modularity
    allows for flexibility and scalability, enabling users to customize their Linux
    systems according to their specific needs.'

- en: 'Collaboration: Linux promotes collaboration among developers and encourages
    the sharing of ideas, code, and expertise. This collaborative environment has
    led to a vast community of developers and users who contribute to the improvement
    and development of the Linux ecosystem.'

- en: 'Choice and Flexibility: Linux offers a wide range of choices and options for
    users. There are numerous distributions (or "distros") available, each with its
    own set of features and configurations. Users have the freedom to select the distribution
    that best suits their needs and preferences.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Portability: Linux is highly portable and can run on a variety of hardware
    platforms, from personal computers to servers, mobile devices, embedded systems,
    and more. This portability allows Linux to be used in diverse environments and
    enables developers to target multiple platforms with their applications.'
