- en: React Native helps web and mobile developers to build apps for iOS and Android
    apps that perform at the same level as any other natively developed app. The range
    of apps that can be built using this library is huge. From e-commerce to games,
    React Native is a good fit for any mobile project due to its flexibility and extendable
    nature. It has good performance, reuses React knowledge, has the ability to import
    npm packages, and uses the same codebase for iOS and Android. There's no doubt
    React Native is not only a good alternative to native development, but also a
    great way to introduce web developers to a mobile project. This book aims to give
    JavaScript and React developers a peek at how some of the most popular apps in
    the market could be built from scratch with React Native. We will build all the
    apps in iOS and Android, except for those cases where the apps only make sense
    on one of the platforms.

- en: Most of the apps built throughout this book will run on Android and iOS, so
    a computer running Linux, Windows, or OSX will be required, although we recommend
    any Apple computer (running OSX 10 or later) to run both mobile platforms at once,
    as some examples will require working on XCode, which is only installable on OSX.

    React skills are needed to follow along, since we won't dive deep into complex
    React patterns.
