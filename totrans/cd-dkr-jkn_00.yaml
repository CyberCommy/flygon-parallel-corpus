- en: 'I''ve observed software delivery processes for years. I wrote this book because
    I know how many people still struggle with releases and get frustrated after spending
    days and nights on getting their products into production. This all happens even
    though a lot of automation tools and processes have been developed throughout
    the years. After I saw for the first time how simple and effective the Continuous
    Delivery process was, I would never come back to the tedious traditional manual
    delivery cycle. This book is a result of my experience and a number of Continuous
    Delivery workshops I conducted. I share the modern approach using Jenkins, Docker,
    and Ansible; however, this book is more than just the tools. It presents the idea
    and the reasoning behind Continuous Delivery, and what''s most important, my main
    message to everyone I meet: Continuous Delivery process is simple, use it!'
