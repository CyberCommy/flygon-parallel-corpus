    was given my first PC (thanks, Mom and Dad), I've always wondered what happened
    when I deleted my files from my massively large 2 GB hard drive or moved (and
    most times hid) my files to a less-than-inconspicuous 3.5-inch floppy diskette
    which maxed out at 1.44 MB (Megabytes) in capacity.

    digital immortality I so confidently believed in. Sadly, many files, documents,
    and priceless fine art created in Microsoft Paint by yours truly were lost to
    the digital afterlife, never to be retrieved again. Sigh. The world shall never
    know.

    associated tools while browsing the magical **World Wide Web** (**WWW**) on my
    lightning-fast 42 Kbps dial-up internet connection (made possible by my very expensive USRobotics
    dial-up modem), which sang the tune of the technology gods every time I'd try
    to connect to the realm of the internet. This process involved a stealthy ninja-like
    skill that would make even a black-ops team envious, as it involved doing so without
    my parents noticing, as this would prevent them from using the telephone line
    to make or receive phone calls. (Apologies dear Mother, Father, and older teenage
    sister).

    as the many great peer-reviewed papers, journals, and books on digital forensics
    widely-available today. As a total novice (also referred to as a noob) in the
    field, I did learn a great deal about the basics of file systems, data and metadata,
    storage measurements, and the workings of various storage media.

    again on a dial-up connection. Just downloading these operating systems was quite
    a feat, which left me feeling highly accomplished as I did not have any clue as
    to how to install them, let alone actually use them. In those days, easy-installation
    and GUIs were still under heavy development, as user friendly, or in my case,
    user unfriendly, as they were at the time (mostly due to my inexperience, lack
    of recommended hardware, and also lack of resources such as online forums, blogs,
    and YouTube...which I did not yet know about). I'll explain more about the Auditor
    and Slax operating systems in [Chapter 2](d2fe7988-be5c-490c-a3b8-22a9db9770b7.xhtml),

    digital forensics could be installed in various Linux distributions or flavors
    and many of these tools were well maintained, constantly being developed and were
    widely accepted by peers in the field. Kali Linux is a Linux distribution or flavor,
    but before we go any further, let me explain the concept of  Linux distribution
    or flavor. Consider your favorite beverage: this beverage can come in many flavors,
    some without sweeteners or sugar, in different colors, and even in various sizes.
    No matter what the variations, it''s still the basic ingredients that comprise
    the beverage, at the core. In this way, too, we have Linux, and then different
    types and varieties of Linux. Some more popular Linux distros and flavors include
    RedHat, CentOS, Ubuntu, Mint, Knoppix, and, of course, Kali Linux. More on Kali
    Linux will be discussed in  [Chapter 2](d2fe7988-be5c-490c-a3b8-22a9db9770b7.xhtml), *Installing

    one follow appropriate best practices and procedures in an effort to produce the
    same results time and time again providing proof of evidence, preservation, and
    integrity which can be replicated ;if called upon to do so.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Although many people may not be performing digital forensics to be used as evidence
    in a court of law, it is best to practice in such a way as can be accepted and
    presented in a court of law. The main purpose of adhering to best-practices set
    by organizations specializing in digital forensics and incident response is to
    maintain the integrity of the evidence for the duration of the investigation.
    In the event that the investigator's work must be scrutinized and critiqued by another
    or an opposing party, the results found by the investigator must be able to be
    recreated, thereby proving the integrity of the investigation. The purpose of
    this is to ensure that your methods can be repeated and, if dissected or scrutinized,
    produce the same results time and again. The methodology used, including the procedures
    and findings of your investigation, should always allow for the maintenance of
    the data’s integrity, regardless of what tools are used.

    is not tampered with, or in cases of investigating devices and data in a live

    thereby preserving the integrity of the evidence. For those completely new to

    for producing the widely adopted best practices for computer evidence (discussed
    later in this chapter). The SWGDE also collaborated with other organizations,
    such as the very popular **American Society of Crime Laboratory Directors** (**ASCLDs**),

    languages, operating systems both average and advanced, and knowledge and utilization
    of digital devices. This also translates into more user-friendly interfaces which
    can accomplish many of the same tasks as with the CLI, used mainly by advanced
    users. Essentially, today’s simple GUI, together with a wealth of resources readily
    found on search engines, can make certain tasks, such as hiding data, far easier

    processors, combined with large amounts of RAM, including devices which can also
    act as RAM, far surpass those of as recent as five years ago. Graphics cards must
    also be mentioned and taken into consideration, as more and more mobile devices
    are being outfitted with very powerful high-end onboard NVIDIA and ATI cards which
    also have their own separate RAM, aiding the process. Considering all these factors
    does lend support to the idea put forth by Gordon E. Moore in the 1970s that states
    that computing power doubles every two years, commonly known as Moore’s Law.

    Lizard Squad, and many others, including individuals and Hacktivists (people that
    hack for a specific cause or reason and are less concerned about doing time in
    prison). Some of these hacks and attacks not only brought down several major networks

    result, the loss of public confidence in the companies contributed to further
    increases in damages.

    and uses technology in very much the same way we use locks and keys to safeguard
    our personal and private belongings. For a lock to open, there must be a specific
    matching key. So too, in the digital world, data is encrypted or locked using
    an encryption algorithm and must use either the same key to decrypt or unlock
    the data. There also exists another scenario where one key may be used to encrypt
    or lock the data and another used to decrypt the data. Two such very popular encryption

    is also the concept of anonymity which adds to the complexity of maintaining an
    accuracy of the true sources found in investigations. Like encryption, there exist
    several free and open source tools for all operating system platforms, such as
    Windows, Mac, Linux, and Android, which attempt and most often successfully mask
    the hiding of someone's digital footprint. This digital footprint usually identifies
    a device by its IP address and **MAC** (**Media Access Control**) address. Without
    going into the network aspect of things, these two digital addresses can be compared
    to a person's full name and home address, respectively.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Even though a person's IP address can change according to their private network
    (home and work) and public network (internet) access, the MAC address remains
    the same. However, various tools are also freely available to spoof or fake one's
    IP and MAC addresses for the purpose of privacy and anonymity. Adding to that,
    users can use a system of routing their data through online servers and devices
    to make the tracing of the source of the sent data quite difficult. This system
    is referred to as proxy chaining and does keep some of the user's identity hidden.
  prefs: []

    proxies worldwide to route or passes the data along from proxy to proxy, making
    the tracing of the source very difficult, but not impossible. You can think of
    proxy chains as a relay race, but instead of having four people, one passing the
    baton to the next, the data is passed between hundreds of proxy devices, worldwide.

    science has been around for a very long time, as far back as the early 1900s.
    Although digital forensics may have only been on the scene since the early 2000s,
    as a science, we have certain best practices, procedures, and standards, such
    as those created by the ACPO and SWGDE, to adhere to. These maintain accuracy
    and the integrity of both the findings and the actual evidence when carrying out
    investigations, whether as an amateur or professional Digital Forensic Investigator.
