- en: Serverless architecture is popular in the tech community due to AWS Lambda.
    Go is simple to learn, straightforward to work with, and easy to read for other
    developers, and now it's been heralded as a supported language for AWS Lambda.
    This book is your optimal guide to designing a serverless Go application and deploying
    it to Lambda.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book starts with a quick introduction to the world of serverless architecture
    and its benefits, then delves into AWS Lambda through practical examples. You'll
    then learn how to design and build a production-ready application in Go using
    AWS serverless services with zero upfront infrastructure investment. The book
    will help you learn how to scale up serverless applications and handle distributed
    serverless systems in production. Then you will also learn to log and test your
    application.

    the deployment process of your Lambda functions. Moreover, you will learn to troubleshoot
    and monitor your applications in near real time with services such as AWS CloudWatch
    and X-Ray. The book will also teach you how to scale up serverless applications
    and secure the access with AWS Cognito.
