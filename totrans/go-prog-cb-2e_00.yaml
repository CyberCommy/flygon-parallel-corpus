- en: Thank you for choosing this book! I hope it will be a handy reference for developers
    to quickly look up Go development patterns. It is meant to be a companion to other
    resources and a reference that will hopefully be useful long after reading it
    once. Each recipe in this book includes working, simple, and tested code that
    can be used as a reference or foundation for your own applications. The book covers
    a range of content from basic to advanced topics.

- en: This book serves as a good reference for Go developers who are already proficient
    but need a quick reminder, example, or reference. With the open source repository,
    it should be possible to share these examples quickly with a team as well. If
    you are looking for quick solutions to common and not-so-common problems in Go
    programming, this book is for you.
