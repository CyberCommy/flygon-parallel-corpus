- en: Relatively new as a UI library, Vue is a very serious challenger to current
    leading libraries such as Angular and React. It has a lot to offer--it is simple,
    flexible, and very fast, yet it still provides all the features necessary to build
    a full-blown modern web app.

- en: Its progressive nature makes it easy to get started with, and then you can use
    more advanced features to scale your app up. Vue also have a rich ecosystem surrounding
    it, including official first-party libraries for routing and state management,
    bootstrapping, and unit-testing. Vue even supports server-side rendering out of
    the box!

    that drive innovation on the web and make Vue a sustainable open source project.

- en: To help you learn Vue and build apps with it, this book is structured as a series
    of six guides. Each guide is a concrete project, in which you will build a real
    application by yourself. This means you will have six Vue apps up and running
    by the end!

- en: Just like Vue, the projects are progressive and introduce new topics step by
    step to make your learning experience easier. The first projects don't require
    extensive configuration or build tools, so you can make concrete apps right away.
    Then, more advanced topics will be progressively added to the project so that
    you will have a complete skill set by the end of the book.
