- en: In a deployment diagram, internet outside the firewall was depicted using the
    shape of a cloud. Not until I read *Big Switch*, Nicholas G. Carr, did I realize
    the full potential of cloud and what was to come. Fast forwarding 10 years, now
    we do not think twice before drawing the cloud shape around the complete system
    to depict how cloud is everywhere. Cloud Native comes naturally for start-ups,
    but for a lot of enterprises, this is still an uncharted territory. Just doing
    lift-and-shift is not the right use of cloud, though it may be the first thing
    most large corporations are doing to mitigate the currency of their data centers
    or to avoid extension of leases. The power of cloud is seen when we are able to
    build cloud-native architecture-based applications that are business critical
    and can drive transformational value. Hence, I have always encouraged my team
    to gain knowledge on designing and building smarter applications on cloud.

- en: Munish, Ajay, and Shyam are part of the core team that has always researched
    and worked on emerging technologies, using them to solve business problems. They
    are among the leading experts and consultants on the enterprise digital transformation
    with a focus on distributed systems using microservices and emerging technologies
    such as reactive frameworks, open source, and container technology (Dockers and
    Kubernetes) to name a few. Hence, I encouraged them to work on this book so as
    to enable the next generation of developers to jump start their journey to cloud-native
    applications.

- en: This book takes a step-by-step approach to understanding, designing, and writing
    applications for cloud. The authors take you on a learning journey that starts
    with the concepts, followed by building a small REST service, and then going through
    the incremental journey of enhancing the service to be cloud native. They cover
    various aspects of cloud-specific nuances, such as how to discover a service in
    a distributed architecture and the role played by service discovery tools. You
    will also learn how to migrate your application to public cloud providers—AWS
    and Azure. The book covers serverless computing models such as AWS Lamda and Cloud
    Functions.
