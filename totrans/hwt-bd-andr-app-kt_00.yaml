- en: Android has ruled the app market for the past decade, and developers are increasingly
    looking to start building their own Android apps. *How to Build Android Apps with
    Kotlin* starts with the building blocks of Android development, teaching you how
    to use Android Studio, the integrated development environment (IDE) for Android,
    with the programming language Kotlin for app development. Then, you'll learn how
    to create apps and run them on virtual devices through guided exercises. You'll
    cover the fundamentals of Android development, from structuring an app to building
    out the UI with Activities and Fragments and various navigation patterns. Progressing
    through the chapters, you'll delve into Android's RecyclerView to make the most
    of displaying lists of data and become comfortable with fetching data from a web
    service and handling images. You'll then learn about mapping, location services,
    and the permissions model before working with notifications and how to persist
    data. Moving on, you'll get to grips with testing, covering the full spectrum
    of the test pyramid. You'll also learn how AAC (Android Architecture Components)
    are used to cleanly structure your code and explore various architecture patterns
    and the benefits of dependency injection. The core libraries of RxJava and Coroutines
    are covered for asynchronous programming. The focus then returns to the UI, demonstrating
    how to add motion and transitions when users interact with your apps. Towards
    the end, you'll build an interesting app to retrieve and display popular movies
    from a movie database, and then see how to publish your apps on Google Play. By
    the end of this book, you'll have the skills and confidence needed to build fully-fledged
    Android apps using Kotlin.
