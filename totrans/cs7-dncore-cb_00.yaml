- en: Visual Studio 2017 allows developers to harness the latest technology and create
    world-class applications across a variety of platforms. The new language features
    in C# 7.0 are powerful tools that will allow you to write better functioning software
    and deliver complex business requirements quicker.

- en: The book takes a look at all of the awesome new features in C# 7\. It also looks
    at how developers can write diagnostic analyzers to produce better code and adhere
    to specific code standards. It explores .NET Core 1.1 and looks at creating an
    ASP.NET Core application using the MVC framework.

    you how to do so using Cordova. If you want to create native iOS applications,
    this book shows you how to do just that using Visual Studio for Mac.

    no further. In the book, we take a look at what the term serverless computing
    means. We also look at how to create an Azure function and how to use AWS and
    S3\. Lastly, hot off the press from Amazon, we take a look at using C# lambda
    functions with AWS.

- en: '[Chapter 1](8920e7d4-52c1-4d01-9703-270f6746a7c9.xhtml)*, New Features in C#
    7.0*, shows how C# 7.0 brings a lot of new functionality to the C# language. The
    biggest of these features by far are Tuples and pattern matching. Getting to grips
    with what’s new in C# 7.0 is essential for developers in order to stay on top
    of their game.'

    form the building blocks of software development and are essential in building
    good code. The power of classes, which is to describe the world around us and
    translate it into a programming language that a compiler can understand, allows
    developers to create great software.'

    this concept is essential to .NET developers everywhere.'

    code. Be sure that the code you or your team ships measures up to your specific
    set of code quality standards.'

    is about how regex make use of patterns that describe a string through the use
    of special characters that denote a specific bit of text to match. The use of
    regex, when applied properly, can be a very powerful approach to certain programming
    problems.'

    and serialization is something you as a developer will do many times. Being able
    to do so correctly will definitely give you an edge as a developer.'

    exciting feature in C#. It allows you to continue program execution on the main
    thread while a long-running task finishes its execution. This enables your applications
    to remain responsive.'

    technology. If you need to create search-as-you-type functionality in an application,
    have data that changes notify your application instead of having to poll the data
    all the time (think stock prices), or generally make your app more responsive,
    the chances are you need to consider using Rx.'

    the MVC Framework*, talks about the MVC framework, which is named according to
    the MVC design pattern it follows. It allows developers to separate the logic
    by letting each component of the framework focus on one specific thing. It is
    this separation of concerns that makes MVC so powerful, especially when combined
    with .NET Core.'

    every developer''s toolkit. It doesn''t matter whether you are a hobbyist or professional
    programmer; when you get up from your desk to go home, you''d better be sure your
    code is safe.'

    Application in Visual Studio*, allows developers to create mobile applications
    with ease. It also gives developers more choice about how to go about doing it.
    From creating a mobile app with Xamarin, to using Cordova, to writing native iOS
    applications with Visual Studio for Mac, .NET developers can expand their service

    do more often than not. Being able to do so efficiently is a different story.
    In a similar way, being able to write secure code is essential to any developer.
    Creating secure code and being able to efficiently debug that code properly results
    in a better end product.'

    on Azure Service Fabric*, is about how, traditionally, developers wrote applications
    in a monolithic manner, which is one single executable broken up into components
    via classes and so on. Microservices is a technology that aims to address the
    issues surrounding traditional monolithic applications. It allows developers to
    create smaller bits (services) that can function on their own without being dependent
    on any of the other services.'

- en: '[Chapter 16](b73df9fb-8756-451b-89fd-4a02f5cdd260.xhtml), *Azure and Serverless
    Computing*, is about how serverless does not mean the lack of a server, but rather
    you (or the application) does not know which server is used to provide some functionality
    to an application. Splitting some of your application logic into a serverless-type
    architecture allows for extreme scalability when loads increase (or decrease),
    increased performance, and less code to write and debug.'
