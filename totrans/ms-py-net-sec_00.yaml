- en: Recently, Python has started to gain a lot of traction, with the latest updates
    of Python adding numerous packages that can be used to perform critical missions.
    Our main goal with this book is to help you leverage Pythons packages to detect
    and exploit vulnerabilities and take care of networking challenges.

- en: This book will start by walking you through the scripts and libraries of Python
    that are related to networking and security. You will then dive deep into core
    networking tasks and learn how to take care of networking challenges. Later, this
    book will teach you how to write security scripts to detect vulnerabilities in
    your network or website. By the end of this book, you will have learned how to
    achieve endpoint protection by leveraging Python packages, along with how to write
    forensics and cryptography scripts.

- en: '[Chapter 3](bd1e16c1-2ce3-4edc-b61d-9845d978c2bd.xhtml), *Sockets Programming*,
    gives you some basics on Python networking using the socket module. The socket
    module exposes all of the necessary pieces to quickly write TCP and UDP clients,
    as well as servers for writing low-level network applications.'

    Traffic*, gives you some basics on analyzing network traffic in Python using Scapy.
     An investigator can write Scapy scripts to investigate either real-time traffic
    by sniffing a promiscuous network interface, or load previously captured `pcap`
    files.'

    many of the examples will work in Python 2, you'll get the best experience working
    through this book with a recent version of Python 3\. At the time of writing,
    the latest versions are 2.7.14 and 3.6.15, and the examples were tested against
    these versions.
