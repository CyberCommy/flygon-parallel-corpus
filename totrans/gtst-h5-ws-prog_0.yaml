- en: The WebSocket protocol is the art of handshaking in the HTML5 world. It defines
    a two-way communication between server and client, resulting in smoother, faster,
    and more efficient web applications. This book will guide you through the whole
    process of creating a modern web app, taking full advantage of the WebSocket's
    capabilities. You will learn, step-by-step, how to configure the client and server,
    transfer text and multimedia, add security layers, and provide fallbacks for older
    browsers. Moreover, you will get a taste of how these techniques work in a native
    mobile and tablet client, unleashing the complete power of the HTML5 WebSocket
    protocol.
