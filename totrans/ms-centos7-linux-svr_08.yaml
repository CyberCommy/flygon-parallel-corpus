- en: According to a study, most of the critical errors that occur in large IT systems
    are due to people and processes. Half of those errors are due to a lack of release
    synchronization, coordination between machines, and configuration management.
    Big machinery and infrastructure are way too hard to manage and maintain for any
    single team. Having an identical configuration set for every machine to make them
    all work in synchronization is a nightmare for management teams. For these reasons,
    we have a process called **Configuration Management** (**CM**).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this chapter, we are going to describe how to use the CM process to maintain
    and manage a CentOS 7 Linux server infrastructure. We are going to describe in
    brief some of the most common open source configuration management tools, with
    an example of setting up a management server with a client using Puppet.

- en: Configuration management is a process that helps organize multiple machines/systems
    so that they can coordinate with each other to perform one rather big process
    or run multiple redundant processes. It is widely used by military organizations
    to manage their systems, such as weapon systems, vehicles, and information systems.
    Outside the military, it is widely used in IT service management for big infrastructure
    handling.

    such as customized scripts (shell scripts, expect scripts, and so on) and manual
    process implementation to run repetitive tasks. We have well acknowledged the
    fact that those techniques are no longer effective, especially when used in large-scale
    infrastructures. Even for small infrastructures, it is hard to track and maintain
    them due to all-time configuration changes. All of this may have a direct impact
    on the reliability of the infrastructure itself, which may also affect the productivity
    of the organization.

    it has also been used to perform other tasks that most system administrators do
    on a daily basis (system updates, firmware patch, release update and management,
    and so on).

- en: For the new generation of system administrators, everything is automated. Most
    machines run on the same set of configurations, and a set of servers to manage
    them all. Everything is watched by monitoring tools. The job of a system administrator
    is to initialize their infrastructure's basic configuration to start their configuration
    management server, set up clients if needed on other machines, and then start
    sending configurations to the clients to apply it. The configuration management
    server will act as the master of the Puppets and send them direct orders to follow
    for whatever their architecture or type of OS is.

    servers that provide a variety of services. Chef uses something called recipes,
    made to describe the desired management (configuration, installation, change)
    for the server's applications and utilities. It is widely used for infrastructure
    with cloud-computing-based platforms (such as Rackspace, Internap, Amazon, Google,
    OpenStack, SoftLayer, and Microsoft) because of its capacity to automatically
    provision and configure new machines on the go. The scalability of Chef allows
    it to be used for small and large infrastructures on demand.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Chef can be executed as a server or a client. The clients are executed on the
    servers/machines that we want to manage using our server. And the Chef server
    agent is installed in one centralized server, on which it manages the recipes
    depending on what the administrator has defined for each node (web server, cluster
    machine, storage server, and so on). Then the client executes the recipes sent
    to it by the server. By default, the client updates its recipe from the server
    every 30 minutes to see whether there is any change that needs to be done.

    so on).

    files to ensure that everyone can understand them, if an update or reconfiguration
    is ever needed. It requires only the SSH password or an SSH key in order to access
    the nodes to be managed, without the need for the installation of an agent. So,
    there will definitely be no need to worry about not having the agent running due
    to an upgrade, patch, or daemon malfunction.

- en: Puppet is an open source configuration management tool designed to manage and
    configure machines within the same infrastructure, to simplify various system
    administration tasks where the user declares the machines' states and resources
    using different ways (Ruby DSL, Puppet declaration language, and others). It is
    published under the GPL and Apache licenses. It is mainly used to manage and configure
    Unix-based machines and Microsoft systems. To establish Puppet, as best practice,
    we require a Puppet server agent to do the role of a configuration management
    server and for the other nodes, the ones the server is going to manage, we require
    the client version. Puppet inspects each node's configuration, and then identifies
    the changes between the old and the new configurations specified at its configuration
    file, if there are any. Then it starts making the required changes to adjust the
    node to the specified state. This task is useful; not only for establishing a
    new configuration, but also for regaining it if anything goes wrong with the machines.

    system administrators, especially when working in a big computer environment.
    We introduced in brief some of the well-known open source solutions used to carry
    out configuration management on Linux servers, especially CentOS 7\. Then we chose
    Puppet as our candidate to show in a step-by-step tutorial how to set up and configure
    master/client architecture. And, finally, we have tested some commands on the
    client nodes.

    administrator using Linux in general and CentOS more specifically should know,
    to better manage and secure their infrastructure in the best-practice ways.
