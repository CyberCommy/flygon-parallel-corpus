- en: Learning a new language or switching to an entirely different technology is
    a common industry demand. As a student one should prepare oneself to be up to
    date with market trends, and as a professional, one should be aware of the new
    things that are coming in with new technologies. To meet this demand, there are
    a lot of books that are of thousand pages long and aim to be comprehensive references
    to the C# programming language.

- en: This book is entirely different and written so that someone who has a very basic
    knowledge of the C# language, or is a professional and working with another language
    but wants to switch, can learn C#. This book was designed with the aim that one
    should start with the basics and progress to an advanced level. The book contains
    concise content with relevant examples to explain everything.

- en: '*Learn C# in 7 Days* is a fast-paced guide. In this book, we take a unique
    approach to teaching C# to an absolute beginner, who will be able to learn the
    basics of the language in seven days. This practical book comes with important
    concepts that introduce the foundation of the C# programming language. This book
    addresses the challenges and issues that most beginners face. It covers issues
    such as the need to learn C#, issues with setting up a development environment
    with C#, challenges such as mathematical operations, and other day-to-day problems.
    Its fast-paced writing style allows the reader to get up and running in no time.
    We begin with the absolute basics in the first chapter (variables, syntax, control
    flows, and so on), and then move on to concepts such as statements, arrays, string
    processing, methods, inheritance, I/O handling, and so on. Every chapter is followed
    by an exercise that focuses on building something with the language. This book
    is a fast-paced guide to get readers upto speed with the language. It works as
    a reference guide, describing the major features of C#. Readers will be able to
    build easy and simple code with real-world scenarios. By the end of this book,
    you will be able to take your skills to the next level, with a good knowledge
    of the fundamentals of C#.'
