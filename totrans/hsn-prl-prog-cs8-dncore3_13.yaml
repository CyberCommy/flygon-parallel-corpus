- en: In this section, we will explain debugging techniques and tools that are available
    for Visual Studio users. The primary focus will be on understanding IDE features
    such as the parallel Tasks window, theÂ Thread window, the Parallel Stacks window,
    and Concurrency Visualizer tools. We will also cover how to write unit test cases
    for code that uses TPL and async programming, how to write mock and stubs for
    test cases, and some tips and tricks to make sure the test cases the test cases
    we write for ORM don't fail.
