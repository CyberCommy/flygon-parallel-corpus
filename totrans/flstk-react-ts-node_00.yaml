- en: According to GitHub, the largest repository for open source software, JavaScript
    is still the most popular programming language in the world. More projects are
    written in JavaScript than any other language. Even projects normally not associated
    with the web, such as machine learning and crypto currencies, often use JavaScript.

- en: The JavaScript programming language is enormously powerful and capable, but
    in addition to the language, there are frameworks, including React and Node, that
    add to the language's capabilities, making it even better. On top of this, TypeScript
    has now become the standard for doing large JavaScript projects. It provides language
    features that make coding with JavaScript more productive and better suited for
    large applications.

- en: Modern web development has advanced tremendously over the years. In the past,
    client code generally meant static HTML and CSS, with perhaps a tiny bit of JavaScript.
    And the backend was usually written in a completely different language, such as
    PHP or CGI scripts. However, it is now common to write the entire application,
    from client to server, using only JavaScript and its related frameworks. This
    ability to write our applications using only a single language provides enormous
    benefits during development. Furthermore, the robust and mature frameworks that
    are available make full stack programming in JavaScript competitive with any other
    platform.

- en: In this book, we will learn to use the power of JavaScript to build complete
    full stack web applications. We will augment this power with TypeScript, another
    powerful top-ten language. Then, using frameworks such as React, Redux, Node,
    Express, and GraphQL, we will build a realistic, fully functional best-practices
    web application that will give you all the knowledge you need in order to build
    modern full stack web applications. And once our application is complete, we'll
    deploy it to AWS cloud services, the world's most popular and feature-rich cloud
    services provider.

    and enter the world of full-stack web development by learning about modern web
    technologies and how they come together. A good understanding of JavaScript programming
    is required before getting started with this web development book.
