- en: This is Day 01 of our seven day journey to learn C#. Today, we will begin with
    an introduction of a new world of programming and will discuss all the basic concepts
    required to learn this programming language. We will also discuss the .NET Framework
    and the .NET Core framework by covering important concepts of the framework. We
    will also get a basic understanding of managed and unmanaged code. At the end
    of the day, we will start with a simple Hello World program.

    what is called a programming language.

    we have .NET Core in place and we are using .NET Core in our book examples with
    C# 7.0 as the language. Before moving ahead, you should know about .NET because
    there is a .NET Standard available with the .NET Core, that is API servers for
    both .NET Framework as well .NET Core. So, if you created a project using .NET
    Standard it is valid for both .NET Framework and .NET Core.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The preceding process is a standard process depicting how compilers compile
    the source code and create executable binaries, but in the case of .NET, the compiler
    (C# compiler for our code) does not directly provide a binary executable; it provides
    an assembly and this assembly consists of metadata and intermediate language code,
    also known as **Microsoft Intermediate Language** (**MSIL**) or **Intermediate
    Language** (**IL**). This MSIL is a high-level language and this can’t be understood
    directly by the machine, as MSIL is not machine-specific code or byte code. For
    proper execution, it should be interpreted. This interpretation from MSIL or IL
    to the machine language happens with the help of JIT. In other words, JIT compiles
    MSIL, IL into the machine language, also called native code. For more information,
    refer to [https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ht8ecch6(v=vs.90).aspx](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ht8ecch6(v=vs.90).aspx).

    In the coming versions, 32-bit compilation will also be handled by RyuJIT ([https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/10](https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/10)).
    After this, we can now have a single code base for both CoreCLR.

    be implemented by all, that is, .NET Framework, .NET Core, and Xamarin. With the
    use of .NET Standard (that is a set of APIs), you are ensuring that your program
    and class library will be available for all targeted .NET Frameworks and .NET
    Core. In other words, .NET Standard will replace **Portable Class Libraries**
    (**PCL**). For more information, refer to [https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2016/09/26/introducing-net-standard/](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2016/09/26/introducing-net-standard/).
