- en: '[Chapter 5](ch05.html "Chapter 5. Platform Fun"), *Platform Fun*, delves into
    systems design and creating some very useful scripts. We will be building an animation
    system that most objects in the game utilize and forecast for collision, and apply
    our own custom gravity to the player. Lastly, we will be creating a three-phase
    Boss fight utilizing all our previous knowledge along with our new systems.'

    the basics of using the Box2D physics system. We will be learning how to assign
    Fixtures to objects and different properties that can be modified. We will be
    creating a Chain and Wrecking Ball that utilizes Revolute Joints, so that each
    piece would rotate with the one preceding it. Also, the chapter covers Draw GUI
    events and the difference between a Sprite''s location as represented in a Room
    versus the location on the screen.'
