- en: This book is about Angular 2 and Bootstrap 4, the two tremendous and most popular
    names in contemporary web development.

- en: Angular 2 is the successor of AngularJS, but better than the predecessor in
    many ways. It combines the maximum speed possible on web browsers and scalability
    when you work with massive data requirements. This makes Angular 2 the first candidate
    of choice when building new systems or upgrading from the old ones.

- en: Bootstrap 4 is the next evolutionary stage of building responsive, mobile-first
    web applications. It can easily and efficiently scale a website from mobile to
    desktop with a single codebase.

    to build robust web-scale or enterprise web applications, you are in the right
    place.

- en: I had the desire to write a book about Angular 2 and Bootstrap 4 that would
    make no assumptions about the reader’s prior experience and knowledge. My mind
    was about the book with full of technical details wherever required. Now, the
    book you are holding in your hands is that desire realized as it is both beginner-friendly
    and technically deep at the same time. It covers everything a developer requires
    to get into serious web development using those two fantastic frameworks.
