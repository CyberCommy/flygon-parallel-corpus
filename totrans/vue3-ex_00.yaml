- en: Vue is one of the leading frameworks with a huge ecosystem and increasing adoption
    due to its ease of use when developing applications and the fact that it can help
    you achieve impressive results during development quickly. This book explores
    the latest Vue version – Vue 3.0 – and how you can leverage it effectively.

- en: You'll learn with the help of an example-based approach, starting with exploring
    the basics of Vue 3 by creating a simple application and looking at features such
    as components, directives, and their usage. To build your knowledge and enable
    you to have confidence in your app-building skills, the book will show you how
    to test that app with Jest and Vue Test Utils. Later, you'll learn how to write
    non-web apps with Vue 3 and create cross-platform desktop apps with the Electron
    plugin. You'll also learn how to create a multi-purpose mobile app with Vue and
    Ionic. As you progress, you'll learn how to develop web apps with Vue 3 that interact
    well with GraphQL APIs. Finally, you'll build a real-time chat app that performs
    real-time communication using Vue 3 and Laravel.

    Knowing how to program with JavaScript features introduced from 2015 onward would
    make understanding this book much easier. Basic TypeScript concepts, such as defining
    interfaces and advanced data types, will be used in [*Chapter 5*](B14405_05_ePub_RK.xhtml#_idTextAnchor056),
    *Building a Multipurpose Calculator Mobile App with Ionic*.

    App with Vue 3, Laravel, and Socket.IO*, covers Laravel, which requires a basic
    understanding of PHP. The backend portions of the more advanced projects also
    require understanding very basic SQL syntax. Commands such as `Select`, `Insert`,
    and `Create table` will be helpful.
