- en: With the advent of massive computer systems, organizations in different domains
    generate large amounts of data at a real-time basis. The latest entrant to big
    data processing, Apache Flink, is designed to process continuous streams of data
    at a lightning fast pace.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book will be your definitive guide to batch and stream data processing
    with Apache Flink. The book begins by introducing the Apache Flink ecosystem,
    setting it up and using the DataSet and DataStream API for processing batch and
    streaming datasets. Bringing the power of SQL to Flink, this book will then explore
    the Table API for querying and manipulating data. In the latter half of the book,
    readers will get to learn the remaining ecosystem of Apache Flink to achieve complex
    tasks such as event processing, machine learning, and graph processing. The final
    part of the book would consist of topics such as scaling Flink solutions, performance
    optimization, and integrating Flink with other tools such as Hadoop, ElasticSearch,
    Cassandra, and Kafka.
