- en: Welcome! If you are looking to learn about and get good at Angular development,
    you're in the right place. This book will aim to instill an Agile and DevOps mindset
    in you so that you confidently create reliable and flexible solutions. Whether
    you consider yourself a freelancer developing software for small businesses, a
    full-stack developer, an enterprise developer, or a web developer, what you need
    to know to design, architect, develop, maintain, deliver, and deploy a web application
    and the best practices and patterns you need to apply to achieve those things
    don't vary all that much. If you're delivering an application to an audience of
    users, in a sense, you are a full-stack developer, since you must be aware of
    a lot of server technologies. In fact, if you master how to deliver Angular applications
    using TypeScript, it won't be difficult for you to write your own RESTful APIs
    using Node.js, Express.js, and TypeScript, but that is beyond the scope of this
    book.

- en: By some definitions, a full-stack developer needs to know everything from catering
    to international copyright law to successfully creating and operating an application
    on today's web. If you're an entrepreneur, in a sense, this is true. However,
    in this book, your culinary skills and your law degree do not apply. This book
    assumes that you already know how to write a RESTful API with the tech stack of
    your choice, and if not, fear not! You can still benefit and understand how to
    work with RESTful APIs.
