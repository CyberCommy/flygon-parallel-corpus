- en: When I started writing the first edition of this book, I knew very little about
    what was expected. Gradually, I learned how to convert each topic into a story.
    I wanted to talk about Python by offering useful, simple, easy-to-grasp examples, but,
    at the same time, I wanted to pour my own experience into the pages, anything
    I've learned over the years that I thought would be valuable for the reader—something
    to think about, reflect upon, and hopefully assimilate. Readers may disagree and
    come up with a different way of doing things, but hopefully a better way.

- en: I wanted this book to not just be about the language but about programming.
    The art of programming, in fact, comprises many aspects, and language is just
    one of them.
  prefs: []

- en: Another crucial aspect of programming is independence. The ability to unblock
    yourself when you hit a wall and don't know what to do to solve the problem you're
    facing. There is no book that can teach it, so I thought, instead of trying to
    teach that aspect, I will try and train the reader in it. Therefore, I left comments,
    questions, and remarks scattered throughout the whole book, hoping to inspire
    the reader. I hoped that they would take the time to browse the Web or the official
    documentation, to dig deeper, learn more, and discover the pleasure of finding
    things out by themselves.

- en: Finally, I wanted to write a book that, even in its presentation, would be slightly
    different. So, I decided, with my editor, to write the first part in a theoretical
    way, presenting topics that would describe the characteristics of Python, and
    to have a second part made up of various real-life projects, to show the reader
    how much can be achieved with this language.

    all the content I wanted to write and make it fit in the amount of pages that
    were allowed. It has been tough, and sacrifices were made.'

    still receive lovely messages from readers, every now and then, who thank me and
    tell me things like *your book has empowered me*. To me, it is the most beautiful
    compliment. I know that the language might change and pass, but I have managed
    to share some of my knowledge with the reader, and that piece of knowledge will
    stick with them.'

- en: And now, I have written the second edition of this book, and this time, I had
    a little more space. So I decided to add a chapter about IO, which was desperately
    needed, and I even had the opportunity to add two more chapters, one about secrets
    and one about concurrent execution. The latter is definitely the most challenging
    chapter in the whole book, and its purpose is that of stimulating the reader to
    reach a level where they will be able to easily digest the code in it and understand
    its concepts.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I have kept all the original chapters, except for the last one that was slightly
    redundant. They have all been refreshed and updated to the latest version of Python,
    which is 3.7 at the time of writing.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When I look at this book, I see a much more mature product. There are more chapters,
    and the content has been reorganized to better fit the narrative, but the soul
    of the book is still there. The main and most important point, empowering the
    reader, is still very much intact.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I hope that this edition will be even more successful than the previous one,
    and that it will help the readers become great programmers. I hope to help them
    develop critical thinking, great skills, and the ability to adapt over time, thanks
    to the solid foundation they have acquired from the book.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Python is the most popular introductory teaching language in the top computer
    science universities in the US, so if you are new to software development, or
    if you have little experience and would like to start off on the right foot, then
    this language and this book are what you need. Its amazing design and portability
    will help you to become productive regardless of the environment you choose to
    work with.
  prefs: []

- en: If you have already worked with Python or any other language, this book can
    still be useful to you, both as a reference to Python's fundamentals, and for
    providing a wide range of considerations and suggestions collected over two decades
    of experience.

- en: You are encouraged to follow the examples in this book. In order to do so, you
    will need a computer, an internet connection, and a browser. The book is written
    in Python 3.7, but it should also work, for the most part, with any recent Python
    3.* version. I have given guidelines on how to install Python on your operating
    system. The procedures to do that change all the time, so you will need to refer
    to the most up-to-date guide on the Web to find precise setup instructions. I
    have also explained how to install all the extra libraries used in the various
    examples and provided suggestions if the reader finds any issues during the installation
    of any of them. No particular editor is required to type the code; however, I
    suggest that those who are interested in following the examples should consider
    adopting a proper coding environment. I have given suggestions on this matter
    in the first chapter.
