    that time (August 2014), no-one was really advocating what I was suggesting. Received
    wisdom for scaling CSS was to abstract visual patterns, normalise designs as much
    as possible and DRY out code. *Enduring CSS* is, in some ways, the antithesis
    of these beliefs.

    of functionality. For example, drop-down menus or search boxes. These nested pieces

- en: On the other hand, the priorities of ECSS are developer ergonomics (understandable
    class-naming conventions), easy maintainability (styles organised by component
    and simple to delete) and style encapsulation (namespacing prevents leaky abstractions).

- en: I hope I've given you enough to consider that obsessing over repeated property
    values and pairs might not be the best use of your time if you are trying to create
    maintainable style sheets. In the next chapter, besides looking at the benefits
    of the ECSS naming convention, I'll also be arguing that a sound organisational
    approach to project maintenance will generate far leaner style sheets in the long
    term than class abstraction and re-use.

  zh: 希望我已经给了你足够的理由来考虑，如果你试图创建可维护的样式表，那么过度关注重复的属性值和对可能不是最好的时间利用。在下一章中，除了看看ECSS命名约定的好处之外，我还会争辩说，对项目维护采取合理的组织方法将比类抽象和重用在长期内生成更精简的样式表。
