- en: Unit testing in modern component-based JavaScript frameworks is not straightforward.
    You need a test suite that is reliable and runs quickly. Components are connected
    to one another, and the browser adds a layer of UI, which makes everything inter-dependent
    while we test components in isolation. Jest is a fully-featured JavaScript testing
    framework that will do all your work for you.
