- en: As OpenStack has begun to be considered more of a mainstream cloud platform,
    the challenge of operating it after it is built has become prevalent. While all
    cloud tasks can be executed via the API or CLI tool on a one-by-one basis, this
    would not be the best way to handle larger cloud deployments. The need for more
    of an automated approach to administering OpenStack is now clear. Most organizations
    are seeking methods to improve business agility and have realized just having
    a cloud is not enough. Being able to improve application deployments, reduce infrastructure
    downtime, and eliminate daily manual tasks can only be accomplished through some
    sort of automation. OpenStack and Ansible will help any organization close that
    gap. With the many Infrastructure-as-a-Service capabilities OpenStack has to offer
    coupled with Ansible, an ease of use configuration management tool, assures a
    more complete cloud implementation.

- en: Whether you are new to OpenStack or a seasoned cloud administrator, this book
    will aid you in managing your OpenStack cloud once it is all set up. Packed with
    real-world OpenStack administrative tasks, we will first step through those working
    examples natively and then transition to walking through instructions on how to
    automate these tasks using one of the most popular open source automation tools,
    Ansible.

- en: Ansible has become a market leader in the Open Source orchestration and automation
    space. With it too being built using Python, similar to OpenStack, it makes for
    an easy marriage. The ability to leverage existing and/or new OpenStack modules
    will allow you to quickly move along your playbook creation.

- en: We will start with a brief overview of OpenStack and Ansible, highlighting some
    best practices. Next, the beginning of each following chapter will allow you to
    become more familiar with handling Cloud Operator administration tasks such as
    creating multiple users/tenants, managing containers, customizing your clouds
    quotas, taking instance snapshots, setting up active-active regions, running cloud
    health checks, and more. Finally, each chapter will conclude with a step-by-step
    tutorial on how to automate those tasks with Ansible. As an added bonus, the fully
    functional Ansible code will be published on GitHub for your reference while reviewing
    the chapter and/or for later review.

    cloud administrative knowledge and familiarity with how Ansible works. As the
    reader, you will be encouraged to put hands to the keyboard and give the tasks
    a try.

- en: In order to truly benefit from this book, it is best to have deployed or have
    access to an OpenStack cloud built using openstack-ansible (OSA) running with
    the Newton release or better. The OSA deployment method provides an environment
    that will install both OpenStack and Ansible.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you plan to deploy any of the other OpenStack distributions, you would still
    just need to be running the OpenStack Newton release or better. As well as, have
    Ansible version 2.1 or better installed on the same nodes or on your workstation.

    be very useful if you plan to add to or edit any of the Ansible playbooks/roles
