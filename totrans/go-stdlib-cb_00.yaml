- en: Thanks for giving this book a chance! This book is a guide that takes you through
    the possibilities of the Go standard library, which has a lot of out-of-the-box
    functionality and solutions. Note that the solutions covered in the book are mainly
    simple demonstrations of how the standard library implementation is used and how
    it works. These recipes are meant to provide a starting point for you to work
    out how to solve your specific problem rather than solve the problem completely.
