- en: Ansible has rapidly grown from a small open source orchestration tool to a full-blown
    orchestration and configuration management tool owned by Red Hat. In this book,
    you will learn how to write playbooks using the core Ansible modules to deploy
    everything from basic LAMP stacks to a full-blown highly available public cloud
    infrastructure.
