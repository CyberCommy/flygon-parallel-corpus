- en: It's getting more common to find yourself responsible for running the code you've
    written as well as developing the features. While many companies still have an
    operations group (generally retitled to SRE or DevOps) that help with expert knowledge,
    developers (like you) are often being asked to expand your knowledge and responsibility
    scope.

- en: There's been a shift to treating infrastructure-like code for some time. Several
    years ago, I might have described the boundary as Puppet is used by operations
    folks and Chef is used by developers. All of that changed with the advent and
    growth first of clouds in general, and more recently with the growth of Docker.
    Containers provide a level of control and isolation, as well as development flexibility,
    that is very appealing. When using containers, you quickly move to where you want
    to use more than one container a time, for isolation of responsibility as well
    as horizontal scaling.

- en: Kubernetes is a project open sourced from Google, now hosted by the cloud-native
    computing foundation. It exposes many of the lessons from Google's experience
    of running software in containers and makes it available to you. It encompasses
    not only running containers, but grouping them together into services, scaling
    them horizontally, as well as providing means to control how these containers
    interact together and how they get exposed to the outside world.

- en: Kubernetes provides a declarative structure backed with an API and command-line
    tools. Kubernetes can be used on your laptop, or leveraged from one of the many
    cloud providers. The benefit of using Kubernetes is being able to use the same
    set of tools with the same expectations, regardless of running it locally, in
    a small lab at your company, or in any number of larger cloud providers. It's
    not exactly the write once, run anywhere promise of Java from days gone by; more
    we'll give you a consistent set of tools, regardless of running on your laptop,
    your company's datacenter, or a cloud provider such as AWS, Azure, or Google.

- en: If you are a full-stack or backend software developer who's interested in, curious
    about, or being asked to be responsible for testing and running the code you're
    developing, you can leverage Kubernetes to make that process simpler and consistent.
    If you're looking for developer-focused examples in Node.js and Python for how
    to build, test, deploy, and run your code with Kubernetes, this book is perfect
    for you.
