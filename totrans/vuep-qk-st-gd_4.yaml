    and how to work with variables and functions. We learned about various values
    that we can tweak to personalize and set up our VuePress site.

    Started with VuePress*, we already installed VuePress on our system. Depending
    on the requirements that we may face, we can choose to install VuePress either
    globally, or as a dependency within an existing package.

    we should have a working installation of VuePress. Plus, now that we have mastered
    the capabilities of static site generators such as VuePress, and how to configure
    them, it is high time we started seeing things in action.

    implementation of VuePress. In other words, we will be building an actual website
    using VuePress. This will help us better understand the workflow in VuePress and
    also give us a more thorough understanding of its underlying concepts.

    content. Most web developers are well aware of Markdown, and a majority of them
    use it on a regular basis. If, by chance, you do not know what Markdown is, or
    are not comfortable working with it, refer to [Chapter 5](fc128d37-9c99-4f63-9a3d-95bdf66b4825.xhtml),
    *Using Markdown in VuePress*, of this book. That said, we will only be touching
    the surface of Markdown elements in this chapter, such as paragraphs, headings,
    and links. So, even a basic awareness about Markdown is more than sufficient for

- en: It is worth pointing out that VuePress generates HTML files based on the Markdown
    files that we have created. It further places all media elements, JS files, and
    CSS files in the assets sub-directory at the `.vuepress/dist` path. The `/img`
    directory consists of images, whereas the `/js` sub-directory consists of, as
    the name suggests, JS files.

    *page not found* errors. We can customize this file to suit our needs, or leave
    it as it is.
