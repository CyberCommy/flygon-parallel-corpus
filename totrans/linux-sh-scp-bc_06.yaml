    date slip a little. This is because the `sleep` command inserts a delay into the

    manually terminated with *Ctrl* + *C* or the `kill` command (or when the machine
    goes down for whatever reason). It is common for automated scripts to just run
    forever.

- en: So now all we have to do is use `grep` to match that time. Unfortunately, there
    is a very subtle problem here. It has been verified that it is possible for this
    to miss from time to time. For example, if the time has just changed to 3:00 am
    and the program is now in the sleep it might already be 3:01 when it wakes up.
    In my early days in computing I had seen code like this all the time in my jobs
    and never gave it a single thought. When some important backups were missed one
    day my team was asked to figure out what was going on and we discovered this issue.
    A quick fix for this would be to change the seconds to 59, however, a better way
    is to use cron which will be shown later in this chapter.

    Feel free to take this out if you want, especially when first writing the script.
    Also notice that `grep` returns `0` when a match is found, non-zero otherwise.

    In this case, the `who` command is piped into the `wc -l` command to count the
    number of lines. This value is then put into the `currusers` variable. If this

    in some cases it will tell you when you attempt to save the file. But it cannot
    check everything so be careful. Also, if a command gets an error `crontab` will
    use the mail system to notify the user. So, with this in mind you may need to
    run the `mail` command from time to time when using cron.
