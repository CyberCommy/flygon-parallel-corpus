    Even as an experienced PHP developer, some of the topics may be new. We will run
    through the basics of **Git** for source control and touch upon automated deployment
    using a Ruby tool called **Capistrano** in later chapters. Don't worry, although
    it's written in Ruby, it's really easy to use even if you have not used Ruby before.

- en: Git is an extremely powerful tool and is relatively easy to start using. Although
    not all projects require the use of source control systems such as Git or **Subversion**,
    they will all benefit from it. A key benefit is the ability to revert to a previous
    version of the code and think of it as a universal "undo" function. Instead of
    the "undo" function working on a single document, it works on the entire project.
    The core team, while developing and enhancing the FuelPHP framework, also uses
    them. If you're not comfortable with source control, the framework can be installed
    manually, but this book will assume you're using Git and source control.
