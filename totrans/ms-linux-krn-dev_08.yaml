- en: Kernel address space is shared by all user-mode processes, which enables concurrent
    access to kernel services and data structures. For reliable functioning of the
    system, it is imperative that kernel services be implemented to be re-entrant.
    Kernel code paths accessing global data structures need to be synchronized to
    ensure consistency and validity of shared data. In this chapter, we will get into
    details of various resources at the disposal of kernel programmers for synchronization
    of kernel code paths and protection of shared data from concurrent access.

- en: A computation operation is considered to be **atomic** if it appears to the
    rest of the system to occur instantaneously. Atomicity guarantees indivisible
    and uninterruptible execution of the operation initiated. Most CPU instruction
    set architectures define instruction opcodes that can perform atomic read-modify-write
    operations on a memory location. These operations have a succeed-or-fail definition,
    that is, they either successfully change the state of the memory location or fail
    with no apparent effect. These operations are handy for manipulation of shared
    data atomically in a multi-threaded scenario. They also serve as foundational
    building blocks for implementation of exclusion locks, which are engaged to protect
    shared memory locations from concurrent access by parallel code paths.

    counters in shared data structures *(*which are used to track concurrent access
    to various kernel data structures), wait-notify flags, and for enabling exclusive
    ownership of data structures to a specific code path. To ensure portability of
    kernel services that directly deal with atomic operations, the kernel provides
    a rich library of architecture-neutral interface macros and inline functions that
    serve as abstractions to processor-dependent atomic instructions. Relevant CPU-specific
    atomic instructions under these neutral interfaces are implemented by the architecture
    branch of the kernel code.

- en: Hardware-specific atomic instructions can operate only on CPU word- and doubleword-size
    data; they cannot be directly applied on shared data structures of custom size.
    For most multi-threaded scenarios, often it can be observed that shared data is
    of custom sizes, for example, a structure with *n* elements of various types.
    Concurrent code paths accessing such data usually comprise a bunch of instructions
    that are programmed to access and manipulate shared data; such access operations
    must be executed *atomically* to prevent races. To ensure atomicity of such code
    blocks, mutual exclusion locks are used. All multi-threading environments provide
    implementation of exclusion locks that are based on exclusion protocols. These
    locking implementations are built on top of hardware-specific atomic instructions.

    until available, causing the caller context to hog the CPU until lock is acquired.
    It is due to this fact that this exclusion mechanism is aptly named spinlock.

    The first block of code in the outer loop attempts to acquire lock atomically
    by invoking the architecture-specific `##_trylock()` routine. Notice that this
    function is invoked with kernel preemption disabled on the local processor. If
    lock is acquired successfully, it breaks out of the loop construct and the call
    returns with preemption turned off. This ensures that the caller context holding
    the lock is not preemptable during execution of a critical section. This approach
    also ensures that no other context can contend for the same lock on the local
    CPU until the current owner releases it.

    call, and the caller context enters the inner loop. This loop is implemented through
    a conditional `while` that spins until lock is found to be available. Each iteration
    of the loop checks for lock, and when it detects that the lock is not available
    yet, it invokes an architecture-specific relax routine (which executes a CPU-specific
    nop instruction) before spinning again to check for lock. Recall that during this
    time preemption is enabled; this ensures that the caller context is preemptable
    and does not hog CPU for long duration, which can happen especially when lock
    is highly contended. It also allows the possibility of two or more threads scheduled

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When a semaphore is used to protect a shared resource, its counter is initialized
    to a number greater than zero, which is considered to be unlocked state. A task
    seeking access to a shared resource begins by invoking the decrement operation
    on the semaphore. This call checks the semaphore counter; if it is found to be
    greater than zero, the counter is decremented and the function returns success.
    However, if the counter is found to be zero, the decrement operation puts the
    caller task to sleep until the counter is found to have increased to a number
    greater than zero.

    needs to be accessible to a specific number of tasks at any point in time, the
    semaphore count can be initialized to the number of tasks that require access,
    say 10, which allows a maximum of 10 tasks access to shared resource at any time.
    For yet other cases, such as a number of tasks that require mutually exclusive
    access to a shared resource, the semaphore count can be initialized to 1, resulting

    mechanisms provided by the kernel, but also made an underlying attempt at appreciating
    the effectiveness of these options, with their varied functionalities and shortcomings.
    Our takeaway from this chapter has to be the tenacity with which the kernel addresses
    these varying complexities for providing protection and synchronization of data.
    Another notable fact remains in the way the kernel maintains ease of coding along
    with design panache when tackling these issues.
