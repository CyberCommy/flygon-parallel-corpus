    There's a lot of research, processes, and analytics that also go into the case
    itself. Consider a scenario where you need to build a house. Sure, we need wood,
    nails, cement, metal, glass, and all other raw materials, and we also require
    the skilled laborers and contractors to construct the structure and piece it together.
    Apart from the materials, tools, and resources, we would have also done our research
    to ensure that we understood what is needed for this to be a successful project.

    consider the weather, and then choose to specify types of materials based on the
    weather, location, soil type, and so on. It goes without saying that there must
    be understanding of fundamental concepts in the field in order to efficiently
    carry out the task. In the same way, we need to have an understanding of the filesystems,
    operating systems, data types, and locations, as well as a thorough understanding
    of methods and procedures for preserving data, storage media, and general evidence.

    took place. In laptops, desktops, mobile devices, and smart devices, data has
    to be stored somewhere, even if it’s just temporarily. Most of us may be familiar
    with hard disk drives within laptops, desktops, mobile devices and so on, but
    we also need to focus on removable and portable storage devices. These include
    DVDs, portable drives, thumb or flash drives, SD and microSD cards, older media
    such as CDs and floppies, and countless more.

    and release of the 305 **RAMAC** (an acronym for **Random Access Method of Accounting
    and Control**), which utilized the first disk storage technology. This revolutionary
    technology weighed in at approximately one ton, and was roughly 16 square feet
    in size. The disk space capacity of this behemoth, however, was only 5 MB (megabytes
    - yes, I said *megabytes*) in size.

    that could amount to as many as millions of cards just to hold a few megabytes.

    of computers was becoming an actual reality. With a price tag of $1,565, owners

    way to store data at a speed equal to its processing time. The IBM 726 magnetic
    tape reader and recorder was one of the first devices to offer this storage, with
    a capacity or tape density of 100 bits per linear inch of tape. *Inch of tape* should
    give an indicator of the size of the tape, which was wound on a large wheel, similar
    to old film roll movie tape.

    is still very much used today, and like many other storage media types has significantly
    decreased in size while increasing capacity and speed.

    or struck. Also, the faster read/ write speeds and access times greatly reduce
    the time taken for the device to boot or start, and even gives an enhanced experience

    or even seconds. Although traditional tools can be used to image and recover data
    from SSDs, I strongly suggest on researching any SSD drive before performing any

    DRAM. SRAM can be found in the CPU cache (**L1** or **Level 1**) and on some chips
    on the motherboard (**L2**/**L3**), although in very small sizes (KB) due to the
    cost and physical size.

    of all our readers, allow me to go into a bit more detail.

    a refresh circuit. The chips need to be constantly refreshed in order to hold
    the data while being accessed. However, between refreshes, a wait-state is created,

    capacitors, which do not have wait-states.

    than the RAM, the swap file or paging file on the disk can store files and programs
    that are being accessed less, leaving the RAM available to store data being frequently
    accessed. This process involves the OS swapping pages of data less frequently
    used, and moving data to the dedicated paging file area on the hard drive.
