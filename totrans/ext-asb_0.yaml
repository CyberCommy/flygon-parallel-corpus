- en: With most companies moving to the cloud, infrastructure needs are growing exponentially.
    The growing data and massive computing power required to store, analyze, and process
    this data adds to the infrastructure needs. With the endlessly increasing number
    of Internet service users and the enormous inflow of data accompanied by a race
    for data mining, big data and cloud services have opened up new data centers and
    expanded upon the existing ones. Also, with constantly scaling infrastructure
    and increasing demands, with the 99.9% uptime promises to keep, automated management
    of infrastructure became the need of the hour. DevOps soon became a necessity
    and the market has flooded with DevOps tools. Ansible is one such open source
    solution that combines orchestration, configuration management, and application
    deployment capabilities in one.

    Code. It helps you deploy your applications and manage configurations, thus making
    life easier. It is an open source project built on Python and has great community
    support. Ansible, in most ways, is sufficient to address most of your requirements.
    With a number of modules and plugins available, Ansible makes everything look
    so easy. Writing and understanding playbooks is smooth.

- en: This book is aimed at advanced users who already have a working knowledge of
    Ansible, we will discuss various extension points that are exposed by Ansible
    and how they can be exploited to fit our requirements. This book covers in detail
    the Ansible Python API, Ansible modules, and Ansible plugins. In this book—by
    means of real-life scenarios—demonstrates how Ansible can be extended to meet
    your requirements. This will take you through a step-by-step process of how you
    can fill in the gaps and become a master of Ansible.
