    at the exact start of an investigation when all the facts on what occurred may
    not have yet been collected or stated. As in any investigation, we should be aware
    of and follow the guidelines, practices, and procedures for acquiring evidence
    in such a way that it is not tampered with or in a worst-case scenario, lost.

- en: At the scene of a crime, let's say a shooting, there are specific items that
    may immediately qualify as evidence. The physical evidence is easily collected,
    put into evidence bags, labeled, and then shipped off to the labs and secure storage
    areas for safekeeping. This evidence may include spent bullet casings, perhaps
    a gun, fingerprints, and blood samples. Let's not forget witness statements and
    **CCTV** (an acronym for **Closed Circuit Television**) footage also. It's also
    of interest to consider the individuals from law enforcement agencies that would
    be at the scene, and the order in which they may have arrived. Seems simple enough.

    not all files may be copied based on their attributes being set to the system

- en: Another cryptographic hash algorithm commonly used in forensics and also used
    in the next chapter is SHA1\. The **Secure Hashing Algorithm-1** (**SHA1**) is
    more secure than MD5 as it produces a 160-bit output instead of a 128-bit output
    as with MD5\. Due to known collision attacks against both MD5 and SHA-1, the safer
    and more robust option for hashing is now *SHA-2*.

- en: SHA-2 is actually a group of hashes and not just one, as with SHA-1, with the
    most common bit-length being SHA-256 which produces a 256-bit output. Alternate
    bit-length algorithms of SHA-2 are SHA-224, SHA-384, and SHA-512.

    or compromised. This means that the integrity of the evidence and physical images
    created remain intact, which will prove useful in forensic cases and expert testimony.

    it would be to remember that the original evidence, particularly hard drives,
    storage media, and RAM images, should only be used to create forensically-sound
    Bitstream copies. The original evidence is never to be worked on.

    who, as per protocol, performs the tasks of documenting and securing the scene
    as well as collecting and preserving the evidence. The first responder should
    have a toolkit with various tools and items for the acquisition of evidence, and
    when handing over the evidence to other parties, ensure that the Chain of Custody
    is maintained.
