- en: Linux is not the name of a specific and full working OS, but implements only
    the essential inner core of an OS, which is referred to as the kernel. Most types
    of Linux OS do not cost anything, but provide thousands of programs and software
    to use completely free of charge. Most of these programs are also open source,
    which means you can view the exact blueprint of how the program has been created
    and it can be changed by anyone. One very important area in which Linux is very
    popular and is used heavily is managing many network services. These are programs
    that run in the background of your Linux server, continuously waiting for external
    events to respond with some kind of action or information. Examples are popular
    internet services such as a web server, which presents websites to the user; main
    servers for email communications; and also database servers to store and deliver
    any kind of data. As mentioned before, Linux is only the name of the kernel part,
    not a full working OS. To make it complete, you need to bundle it together with
    all kinds of programs, which is then referred to as a **distribution**.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Nowadays, one can choose between an insane amount of different Linux distributions,
    all designed for a special purpose and all with their own pros and cons. The main
    difference between them is the software selected and bundled together with the
    Linux kernel. The most important Linux distribution families are Red Hat- and
    Debian-based Linux distributions. CentOS is one of the most important free Red
    Hat-based Linux server distributions out there at the moment. It's a very stable,
    secure, and reliable OS, which is why it's often used in running very critical
    networking services in enterprise environments. Also, it's good to know that the
    development of this OS is very strong and updates are well selected and suitably
    tested. The first chapter of this book is about installing Linux; here we will
    be starting easy by introducing you to the concepts of virtualization. Then, we
    will create a new CentOS 7 **virtual machine** (**VM**) using a free virtualization
    software called VirtualBox.

    We will also show you how to work with VirtualBox, and afterward show you how
    you can install your first CentOS 7 virtual machine in VirtualBox. It is a very
    hot topic and the core IT skill at the moment is virtualization.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Simply put, it is a technology to run separate operating systems parallel to
    your main operating system on the same computer. For example, if you are currently
    working on a Windows computer, you can run another operating system such as Linux
    or macOS in parallel to a simple Windows application on your desktop. Modern virtualization
    software does not even limit you to run only one parallel OS, but you can run
    multiple systems in parallel. The limits are only defined by your own computer
    hardware. The applications for virtualization technology in modern IT are endless,
    and you will find them everywhere. The advantages can range from shifting IT infrastructure
    paradigms to undoing changes to your operating systems, which is quite ideal for
    beginners.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In cloud computing or modern data centers, powerful virtualization server clusters
    are running many different operating systems simultaneously, instead of using
    dedicated server hardware. If you wanted to use Linux before the age of virtualization,
    you needed access to dedicated physical computers. Also, most beginners will mess
    up their new Linux installation several times when starting out on Linux. Oftentimes,
    such system changes can be hard to reboot and the only efficient and useful consequence
    is to reinstall a complete system when getting stuck. Virtualization gets rid
    of all these problems. We will use it for conveniently working with all the examples
    throughout the entire chapter thanks to its powerful features such as cloning,
    taking snapshots, or creating images, which also eliminates the fear of breaking
    something. At the moment, there is a broad range of different virtualization products
    available for both desktop and non-graphical server environments to choose from,
    both in the commercial and open source sector.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: At the core level, all of these different virtualization products have the same
    basic features and common definitions, which we need to make clear before we can
    dive deeper. When we talk about operating systems running in parallel to your
    physical machine's operating system, we will refer to them as VMs, or virtual
    machines, from this point forward. In the same context, our main operating system
    running our physical machine which runs the virtualization software is called
    the **host system** or **hypervisor**. The VMs running on this host are called
    the **guest systems** or **guests**. Copying and cloning is one of the most important
    features of virtualization. This can save you precious time, for example, if you
    need another identical machine or to make your work more portable. Just copy the
    image to your laptop or a different data center and you're done. The portable
    copy of a VM is also called an **image**. Another awesome feature is taking snapshots
    of your VM. Taking such a snapshot only takes a few seconds but will save the
    complete and current state of your VM at any given point in time. This is very
    useful if you want to preserve a given version of your VM you may later want to
    revert to. Another feature different virtualization products have in common are
    the types of supported network modes.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'The different modes a VM can use to connect to a network can be as follows:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**NAT**: All incoming and outgoing network traffic of your guest VM will go
    through the host network adapter. This means that the VM is not visible in the
    network we are currently on and we only see our host''s MAC and IP addresses.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Bridged**: This network mode means the VM exposes itself and connects to
    the surrounding physical network as if it were a normal physical machine with
    its own unique MAC address. A DHCP server in this network will give the machine
    its own IP address that differs from the host machine.'
  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    to its host and not the rest of the network.'
  prefs:

- en: '**Specific virtual network**: This is a very great feature where you can define
    private and isolated subnet works, independent of the surrounding physical network,
    and then associate VMs to it. This can be useful so that only VMs can see and
    talk to other machines, which are in the same virtual network.'

    server to execute commands on it. Such a connection can be done using SSH. This
    is a system for remotely accessing and using Linux servers. It uses strong encryption
    for secure connections. As SSH is one of the most fundamental core services for
    communication on any Linux server, it is already installed and enabled on CentOS
    7\. All we need to do is run an SSH client within our terminal emulator program,
    which can connect and communicate with any server running the SSH service on Linux
    and macOS, a terminal emulator program, and an open source, as a stage client
    is already installed by default and ready to use.

- en: On Windows, you need to install the program PuTTY, which contains not only the
    SSH client program, but is also a fully operational terminal emulator. Before
    we can access the CentOS 7 SSH service, we need to make its correct network address
    available to the host system where our terminal emulator is running. A correct
    network connection for communicating between a client and server always consists
    of an IP address, or domain name, bundled together with a specific port number.
    The domain name or IP is like a house number, whereas the port number is like
    the exact apartment number in that house. We always need both values for the correct
    delivery of network packages. By default, the ports of any guest VM are not available
    to the outside host system, so we first need to create the link between the host
    and the guest by using a feature that is called **port forwarding**. SSH, by default,
    is running on port `22`, but this low port number cannot be used for forwarding
    to by non admin users or route users. As we are running VirtualBox as a normal
    user, we need to forward port `22` to a user port higher than `1024`.
