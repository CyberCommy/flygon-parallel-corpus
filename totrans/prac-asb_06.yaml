- en: In this section, we will cover the important concepts of Ansible plugins and
    modules. We will cover both their effective use and how to expand Ansible's capabilities
    by writing your own plugins and modules. We'll even look at the requirements for
    submitting your modules and plugins back to the official Ansible project. We'll
    also look at coding best practices, as well as some advanced Ansible techniques
    that allow you to safely automate your infrastructure even when you are working
    with a clustered environment.
