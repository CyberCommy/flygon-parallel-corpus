- en: This book is about building production-ready microservices using Spring Boot
    and Spring Cloud. Five years ago, when I began to explore microservices, I was
    looking for a book like this.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book has been developed after I learned about, and mastered, open source
    software used for developing, testing, deploying, and managing landscapes of cooperating
    microservices.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book primarily covers Spring Boot, Spring Cloud, Docker, Kubernetes, Istio,
    the EFK stack, Prometheus, and Grafana. Each of these open source tools works
    great by itself, but it can be challenging to understand how to use them together
    in an advantageous way. In some areas, they complement each other, but in other
    areas they overlap, and it is not obvious which one to choose for a particular
    situation.

- en: This is a hands-on book that describes step by step how to use these open source
    tools together. This is the book I was looking for five years ago when I started
    to learn about microservices, but with updated versions of the open source tools
    it covers.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book is for Java and Spring developers and architects who want to learn
    how to break up their existing monoliths into microservices and deploy them either
    on-premises or in the cloud, using Kubernetes as a container orchestrator and
    Istio as a service mesh. No familiarity with microservices architecture is required
    to get started with this book.

- en: A good understanding of Java 8, along with a basic knowledge of Spring Framework,
    is required. A general understanding of the challenges of distributed systems,
    in addition to some experience of running your own code in production, will also
    be beneficial.
