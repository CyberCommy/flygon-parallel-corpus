    team is makes continuous small changes in the code and integrates them back into
    the original codebase. After each change, the developer pushes it to GitHub and
    the tests run automatically in that change. This helps to check whether there
    are any bugs or issues in the changed code.

- en: Consider a scenario where multiple developers are working on the same application.
    Each developer is working on a different feature on separate branches. They all
    build the features and write the test code for the features they build. Everything
    is going well. Then when the features are completed, they try to integrate all
    the features, and all of a sudden everything breaks. The tests also fail and many
    bugs start to creep out.

    could be fixed easily. But if it's a large project, then it would be very hard
    just to figure out what went wrong, let alone fix it all. That is where CI originated.
  id: totrans-6

- en: CI came into practice to mitigate such risks while integrating software. The
    rule for CI is to integrate early and often, which helps to identify the bugs
    and problems early in the process of adding new functionalities to the existing
    codebase. So instead of waiting for the completion of every component, CI encourages
    us to build the codebase and run the test suites on every single change that is
    committed to the codebase.

    necessary changes to fix the bug, makes a commit, and pushes the fixed code changes
    to the repository. Again, the same process is repeated until the tests pass. Hence,
    if there are any bugs, they are identified early on and fixed early on.

- en: In this chapter, we learned what CI is and how to use it to make the build automatic
    in the application. We also learned about how to deploy apps using Heroku integration.
    Overall, we learned how to build a full-stack web application using the Vue.js
    and Node.js technologies, we integrated a different authentication mechanism,
    and we also learned how to write tests for the application and make deployments
    for the application. Congratulations!
