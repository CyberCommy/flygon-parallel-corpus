    a look at the ever-growing collection of core Ansible modules that support and
    interact with Windows-based servers. Personally, coming from an almost exclusively
    macOS and Linux background, it felt a little odd to be using a tool that is not
    natively supported on Windows to manage Windows.

    Windows EC2 instance we will be launching in AWS will be fully licensed and therefore
    will carry an additional cost on top of the EC2 resource costs. As always, you
    can find complete copies of the playbooks in the accompanying repository at [https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Learn-Ansible/tree/master/Chapter12](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Learn-Ansible/tree/master/Chapter12).

    the **Windows Remote Management** (**WinRM**) protocol, as well as Ansible, to
    interact with the virtual machine. By default, the `config.vm.communicator` is
    SSH, so overriding this with `winrm` means that we have to provide `config.winrm.username`
    and `config.winrm.password`.

    on the virtual machine, nor to add any additional IP addresses or network interfaces;
    instead, it should just forward the port from our localhost machine to the host.

- en: As mentioned at the start of the chapter, using a traditional Linux tool such
    as Ansible on Windows always feels a little strange. However, I am sure you will
    agree that the experience is as Linux-like as possible. When I first started experimenting
    with the Windows modules, I was surprised that I managed to launch an EC2 Windows
    Server instance and managed to deploy a simple web application without ever having
    to remote-desktop into the target instance.
