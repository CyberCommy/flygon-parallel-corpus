    system work long term in real life, from the observability of the system, which
    is critical for detecting and fixing problems quickly, to handling the configuration
    that affects the whole system and includes techniques for ensuring that the different
    teams collaborate and develop systems in a coordinated fashion.

    a live cluster in order to detect usage and associated problems. This chapter
    introduces the concept of observability and the two main tools for supporting
    it: logs and metrics. It covers how to include them properly in a Kubernetes cluster.'

    across different microservices and how to work with dependencies between services.
    It also shows how to deal with secrets in real life: configuration parameters
    that contain sensible information, such as security keys and certificates.'
