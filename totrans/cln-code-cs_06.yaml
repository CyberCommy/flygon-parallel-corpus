    on existing code, the more you begin to appreciate the need for unit testing.

    constructive feedback that gets the desired results without offending people.
    That is why you should take clean coding very seriously, because if you criticize
    a person's code, you open yourself up for a backlash if your own code is not up

- en: That is why, as a tech lead, it is a good idea for you to encourage TDD. The
    best way to do that is by *leading by example*. Now I know that even degree-educated
    and experienced programmers can be very stand-offish to TDD. One of the most common
    reasons is that it can be hard to learn and put into practice, and appear to be
    more time consuming, especially when code becomes more complex. I have experienced
    these kinds of objections from my colleagues who prefer not to unit test.

  zh: 因此，作为技术负责人，鼓励TDD是一个好主意。最好的方法是*以身作则*。现在我知道，即使是受过学位教育和经验丰富的程序员也可能对TDD持保留态度。最常见的原因之一是学习和实践起来可能很困难，而且在代码变得更加复杂时，TDD可能会显得更加耗时。我曾经从那些不喜欢单元测试的同事那里听到过这种反对意见。
- en: But as a programmer, if you want to be truly confident (such that once you've
    written a piece of code, you can be confident in its quality and that it will
    not be returned to you to fix your own bugs), then TDD is a fantastic way to up
    your game as a programmer. When you learn to test first before you start programming,
    it soon becomes *habitual*. Such a habit, as a programmer, is very useful and
    beneficial to you, especially when there comes a time to find a new position,
    as many employment opportunities advertise for people with TDD or BDD experience.

  zh: 但作为一个程序员，如果你想真正自信（一旦你编写了一段代码，你就能对其质量有信心，并且不会被退回来修复自己的错误），那么TDD是提升自己作为程序员水平的绝佳方式。当你学会在开始编程之前先进行测试，这很快就会成为*习惯性*。作为程序员，这样的习惯对你非常有用和有益，尤其是当你需要找新工作时，因为许多就业机会都在招聘具有TDD或BDD经验的人。
- en: Another thing to consider while writing code is that bugs in a simple, non-critical
    note-taking app are not the end of the world. But what if you work in the defense
    or health sectors? Consider a weapon of mass destruction that has been programmed
    to go in a specific direction to hit a specific target in enemy territory, but
    something goes wrong, and the missile aims for civilian populations that belong
    to your allies. Or, consider what would happen if you had a loved one that was
    on critical life support that died because of a bug in the software of the medical

- en: It is important to understand why, as a programmer, you should learn to test
    your own code. It is true what they say that *"programmers should never test their
    own code"*. But it is only true in the context where the code is finished and
    ready for testing before it goes into production. So while the code is still being
    programmed, programmers should always be testing their own code. Yet some businesses
    are so time-constrained that proper QA is often sacrificed so that the business
    can be the first to market.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 作为程序员，了解为什么应该学会测试自己的代码是很重要的。他们说“程序员永远不应该测试自己的代码”是对的。但这只适用于代码已经完成并准备好进入生产测试之前的情况。因此，在代码仍在编程过程中，程序员应该始终测试自己的代码。然而，一些企业时间非常紧迫，以至于适当的质量保证经常被牺牲，以便企业能够率先上市。
- en: It may be very important for a business to be the first to market, but first
    impressions count. If a business is first to market, and the product has some
    serious flaws that become globally broadcast, this can have a long-lasting negative
    impact on a business. So you must think very carefully as a programmer and do
    your best to ensure that if the software has flaws, you are not the one responsible.
    When things go wrong in a business, heads will roll. And in Teflon Management,
    the managers will pass the guilt for driving ridiculous deadlines from themselves
    all the way down to the programmers that had to meet the deadline and make sacrifices
    to do so.

  zh: 对于企业来说，率先上市可能非常重要，但第一印象至关重要。如果一个企业率先上市，而产品存在严重缺陷并被全球广播，这可能会对企业产生长期的负面影响。因此，作为程序员，你必须非常谨慎，并尽力确保如果软件存在缺陷，你不是责任人。当企业出现问题时，责任人将会受到惩罚。在不粘锅管理中，管理人员会把推动荒谬的截止日期的罪责从自己身上转嫁到不得不满足截止日期并做出牺牲的程序员身上。
- en: So you see, it is very important as a programmer that you test your code and
    test it often, especially prior to releasing it to the testing team. That is why
    you are actively encouraged to transition into the mindset and habitual behavior
    of writing your tests first, based upon the specification that you currently implementing.

    also find that your confidence in your ability to modify the code without breaking
    it may also be greatly improved. Obviously, there is more code in the sense that
    you have the production method and the test method(s). But you may actually end

- en: Picture yourself at your computer with a software specification that you have
    to translate into working software. A bad habit that many programmers have, and
    that I've been guilty of in the past, is that they jump straight into coding without
    doing any real design work. In my experience, this actually prolongs the time
    it takes to develop a piece of code and can often lead to more bugs and code that
    is hard to maintain and extend. In fact, although it appears to be counter-intuitive

    classes in multiple assemblies, it is often useful to provide fake or mock objects
    for the classes under test to keep them atomic. The output must determine whether
    it passes or fails. Good unit tests must never be inconclusive.

  zh: 单元测试必须是原子的，这意味着它们只能测试一件事。由于方法可以在同一个类中链接在一起，甚至可以跨多个程序集中的多个类进行链接，因此为了保持它们的原子性，通常有必要为受测试的类提供虚假或模拟对象。输出必须确定它是通过还是失败。良好的单元测试绝对不能是不确定的。
- en: 'The result of a test should be repeatable, in that it either always passes
    or always fails in given conditions. That is, the same test run over and over
    again should not have different outcomes each time it is run. If it does, then
    it is not repeatable. Unit tests should not have to rely on other tests being
    run before them, and they should be isolated from other methods and classes. You
    should also aim for unit tests that run in milliseconds. Any test that takes one
    second or more to run is taking too long. If code takes longer than a second,
    then you should consider refactoring or implementing a mock object for testing.
    And since we are busy programmers, unit tests should be easy to set up and not
    require a lot of coding or configuration. The following diagram shows the unit
    testing life cycle:'

  zh: 测试的结果应该是可重复的，即在特定条件下，它要么总是通过，要么总是失败。也就是说，同一个测试一遍又一遍地运行时，每次运行都不应该有不同的结果。如果有的话，那么它就不是可重复的。单元测试不应该依赖于其他测试在它们之前运行，并且它们应该与其他方法和类隔离开来。您还应该力求使单元测试在毫秒内运行。任何需要一秒或更长时间才能运行的测试都太长了。如果代码运行时间超过一秒，那么您应该考虑重构或实现一个用于测试的模拟对象。由于我们是忙碌的程序员，单元测试应该易于设置，不需要大量编码或配置。以下图表显示了单元测试的生命周期：

- en: The testing tools we'll be looking at within Visual Studio are **MSTest**, **NUnit**,
    **Moq**, and **SpecFlow**. Each testing tool creates a console application and
    the relevant test project. NUnit and MSTest are unit testing frameworks. NUnit
    is much older than MSTest, and so has a more mature and full-featured API compared
    to MSTest. I personally prefer NUnit over MSTest.

  zh: 我们将在Visual Studio中查看的测试工具有**MSTest**、**NUnit**、**Moq**和**SpecFlow**。每个测试工具都会创建一个控制台应用程序和相关的测试项目。NUnit和MSTest是单元测试框架。NUnit比MSTest早得多，因此与MSTest相比，它具有更成熟和功能齐全的API。我个人更喜欢NUnit而不是MSTest。
- en: Moq is different from MSTest and NUnit as it is not a testing framework but
    a mocking framework. A mocking framework replaces the real classes in your project
    with mock (fake) implementations that are used for testing purposes. You can use
    Moq together with MSTest or NUnit. And finally, SpecFlow is a BDD framework. You
    start by writing a feature in a feature file using business language that the
    user and the techy alike will understand. Then a step file is generated for that
    feature. The step file contains the methods as steps necessary to implement that
    feature.

  zh: Moq与MSTest和NUnit不同，因为它不是一个测试框架，而是一个模拟框架。模拟框架会用虚拟（假的）实现替换项目中的真实类，用于测试目的。您可以将Moq与MSTest或NUnit一起使用。最后，SpecFlow是一个BDD框架。您首先使用用户和技术人员都能理解的业务语言在一个特性文件中编写一个特性。然后为该特性生成一个步骤文件。步骤文件包含实现该特性所需的方法作为步骤。

    developers to then develop step definitions for the feature statements. Once the
    step definitions have been created, the next step is to create the external project
    to implement the feature and add a reference to it. The step definitions are then
    extended to implement the application code for the feature.

    deliver on what the business has asked for, rather than give them what you think
    they asked for. This can save the business a lot of money and hours. Past history
    has shown that many projects failed because of the lack of clarity on what needed
    to be delivered between the business teams and the programming teams. BDD helps
    to alleviate this potential hazard when developing new features.

    TDD. In the previous section, you saw how we can create feature files and generate
    step files from them to write code that meets a business need. Another way to
    ensure that your code meets the business requirements is with TDD. With TDD, you
    start with a test that fails. Then, you write just enough code to make the test
    pass, and as the need arises, you perform refactoring of your new code. This process
    is repeated until such time as all the features have been coded.

    with project stakeholders to design new software, or extensions and modifications
    to existing software. Some software is critical and cannot afford to be buggy.
    Such software includes financial systems that handle private and business investments;
    medical equipment, including critical life support and scanning equipment, that
    requires functional software for it to work; transport signaling software for
    traffic management and navigation systems; space flight systems; and weapon systems.

  id: totrans-245
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Well, you've been given a specification to write a piece of software. The first
    thing you need to do is create your project. Then, you write the pseudocode for
    the functionality that you are going to implement. You then progress to writing
    the tests for each piece of pseudocode. The test fails. You then write the required
    code that causes the test to pass, and then you refactor your code as needed.
    What you are doing here is writing code that is well tested and robust. You are
    able to guarantee that your code will execute as expected in isolation. If your
    code is a component of a larger system, then it will be the responsibility of
    the test team to test the integration of your code, not you. You, as a developer,
    have earned the confidence in your code to release it to the test team. If the
    test team identify use cases that have previously been overlooked, they will share
    them with you. You will then write further tests and make them pass before releasing
    the updated code to them. Such a way of working ensures that code is of the highest
    standard and can be trusted to work as expected by given the expected outputs
    for the given inputs. And finally, TDD makes software progress measurable, which
    is good news for managers.

    and tests grow and we start to refactor, some code will become redundant. Any
    code that is redundant and does not get called is known as **dead code**. Dead
    code should always be removed as soon as it is identified. Dead code will not
    be executed in compiled code, but it is still part of the code base that needs
    to be maintained. Code files with dead code are longer than they need to be. Apart
    from the unnecessary fact that it makes your files bigger, it can also make reading
    source code harder, as it may cut through the natural flow of the code and add
    confusion and delay to the programmer reading it. Not only that, but the last
    thing any programmer new to the project needs is to waste valuable time trying
    to understand dead code that will never be used. So it is best to get rid of it.

    just add noise to the code file, and a surprising number of programmers can become
    really irritated by them. There is one group of programmers that will comment
    on everything. Another group won't comment on anything as they believe the code
    should read like a book. And then there are those who take a balanced approach,
    and only comment on code when it is deemed necessary for people to understand
    the code.

    First of all, the programmer who wrote the comment should have stuck with the
    code and not moved on until the conditions that generate the bug were identified,
    and then the bug should have been fixed. If you know who the programmer is who
    wrote the comment, then return the code to them to fix and remove the comment.
    I have seen code like that on more than one occasion, and I've seen comments on
    the web expressing these strong sentiments about such comments. I suppose it is
    a way to deal with lazy programmers. Should they not be lazy, but rather simply

    time. Also, if your company has CI/CD pipelines that also run tests in the cloud,
    then the redundant tests and dead code add business costs to the build, test,
    and deploy pipelines. This means that the fewer lines of code you upload, build,
    test, and deploy, the less your company has to fork out on running costs. Remember,
    running processes in the cloud costs money and the aim of a business is to spend
    as little money as possible, but rake in plenty of money.
