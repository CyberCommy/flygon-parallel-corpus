    We will cover its predecessors in graphic design since 1950, moving on to how
    important skeuomorphic design was in the process of making flat design one of
    the biggest trends in digital design in the last few years.

    adopted by some of the biggest brands in the market, and how we interact everyday
    with interfaces designed in flat design. There's also a simple exercise to help
    you understand how to build a skeuomorphic element and its flat counterpart, to
    better clarify the differences between skeuomorphic and flat design.

- en: Flat design is a digital design style that was one of the most discussed trends
    throughout 2013\. It is characterized by a really minimalistic look, focused on
    removing all extra elements and effects from a design, such as bevels, shadows,
    lighting effects, depth, texture, and every element that creates and gives an
    extra dimension to these elements.

    seems visually flat on the screen, by using white space, bright colors, and simple
    lines as layout elements. Flat design, as a style, rose quickly to fame and to
    mass use because of its impactful look but surprisingly simple approach. It started
    to gather a big fan base and supporters of the style, because most people saw
    in flat design an opportunity for them to be able to create a simple and good
    looking web page.

    as there were many supporters, there were also a large number of people opposed
    to such a style and against the importance and discussion of it.

    was because of its timing. Flat design came in a time when skeuomorphic design
    was one of the most famous and used styles in digital design and interfaces. They
    contrasted in such a significant way that it was indeed a really rough and extreme
    transition for users of these apps as well as for designers that needed to switch
    their design style to accommodate the users' wishes and expectations. And what
    is skeuomorphic design, you say?

- en: Flat design as a digital design trend and name surfaced on the web around 2012\.
    As a response and alternative to skeuomorphic designs, the first adopters got
    a lot of attention because it was considered a risk to go down a path of creating
    such simple and clear layouts, opposed to the complex and heavy ones being created
    at the time. This shift of trends is something that always happened, as history
    shows. Fashion and style are cyclic, and in this day and age where everything
    is digital, these cycles tend to be even shorter and changes can happen quicker
    than ever.

    development of the International Typographic Style (or the Swiss Style). This
    style was also focused on creating a clean, readable design in contrast to the
    complex illustrations, textures, and photos used in printed posters at the time.
    It was also when Akzidenz-Grotesk, the first version of the typeface that would
    eventually become Helvetica, started to be used more often, which gave a newfound
    strength and focus on sans-serif typography. Typography was one of the big focus
    points of the posters of the Swiss Style, specifically big sans-serif type, thus
    creating a really impactful message. We can say that this is historically the
    first form of flat design.

    responsible for pushing this kind of minimalistic look forward with the launch
    of the Zune music player in 2006\. Even though the device in itself wasn''t a
    commercial success, its interface was revolutionary. The focus on thin and big
    typography, and its clear and minimalistic approach to its navigation and iconography,
    was one of the roots for today''s Microsoft interfaces redesign, which can still
    be found on the strongly typographic menus presented on the Windows Phone. Zune
    also influenced other products, such as the Xbox 360 dashboard and Windows 8\.
    The Windows 8 interface, known by the code name **Metro UI**, was also one of
    the biggest interface overhauls that emphasized the flat design style. It was
    a great change of look for Microsoft Windows and a really bold one that generated
    a lot of appraisal by the design community and influenced a lot of websites that
    try to replicate the squared layout up to this day. The following screenshot shows
    the use of flat design in Metro UI:'

- en: But getting back to the definition of flat design, this as a term and as a style
    was defined by designers who wrote about this subject. One of them, Allan Grinshtein,
    from LayerVault—a version control for designers—wrote in his post *The Flat Design
    Era* ([http://layervault.tumblr.com/post/32267022219/flat-interface-design](http://layervault.tumblr.com/post/32267022219/flat-interface-design))
    how he believes that *elegant interfaces are ones that have the most impact with
    the fewest elements*. This, along with the success and great feedback on the LayerVault
    flat design interface, reinforced the notion that a very minimalistic interface
    can be thought out to be usable and achieve great success among an application's
    user base. At this time, and with the success of the first bold designers, the
    community followed and adhered to this style, creating an enormous number of design
    proposals and applications following the flat design aesthetic.

    users. It was a style that focused a lot on the detail and texture, making the
    interface heavier and often more complex, but interesting because of the clear
    connection to the real objects depicted here. It was an enjoyable and rich experience
    for the user due to the high detail and interaction that a skeuomorphic interface
    presented, which served to attract the eye to the detail and care put into these
    designs; for example, the page flip in iBooks, visually representing the swipe
    of a page as in a traditional book. But this style also had its downsides.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Besides being a harsh transition from the traditional interfaces (as in the
    case of Apple, in which it meant coming from its famous glassy and clean looking
    Aqua interface), several skeuomorphic applications on the desktop didn't seem
    to fit in the overall OS look. Apart from stylistic preferences and incoherent
    looks, skeuomorphic design is also a bad design choice because the style in itself
    is a limitation to innovation. By replicating the traditional and analogical designs,
    the designer doesn't have the option or the freedom to imagine, create, and design
    new interfaces and interactions with the user. Flat design, being the extremely
    simple and clear style that it is, gives all the freedom to the designer by ignoring
    any kind of limitations and effects. But both styles have a place and time to
    be used, and skeuomorphic is great for applications such as Propellerheads that
    are directly replacing hardware, such as audio mixers. Using these kinds of interfaces
    makes it easier for new users to learn how to use the real hardware counterpart,
    while at the same time previous users of the hardware will already know how to
    use the interface with ease.

    extra elements and adapting it to a minimalistic style.

    with the rounded rectangle tool, with a radius of 20 px. This will be the face
    of our button. To make it easier to visualize the element while we create it,
    let's make it gray (`#a2a2a2`).![Exercise 1 – the skeuomorphic and flat buttons](img/0048OS_01_01.jpg)

    Just duplicate the layer (*command* + *J* on Mac or *Ctrl* + *J* on Windows) and
    pull it down to 10 or 15 px, whichever you prefer. Let's make this new rectangle
    a darker shade of gray (`#393939`) and make sure that this layer is below the
    face layer. You should now have a simple gray button with some depth. The side
    layer simulates the depth of the button by being pulled down for just a couple
    of pixels, and since we made it darker, it resembles a shadow.![Exercise 1 – the

    just by looking at the screen, until you find that it sits correctly in the center

    sure it's above our `face` layer. Now to define the layer as a texture and use
    our button as a mask, we're going to right-click on the layer and click on **Create
    clipping mask**. This will mask our texture to overlay the button face.![Exercise

    and repeat the preceding instructions for the side layer. After that, and to have
    a different look, move the `wood-face` layer around and look for a good area of
    the texture to use on the side, ideally something with some up strips to make
    it look more realistic.![Exercise 1 – the skeuomorphic and flat buttons](img/0048OS_01_05.jpg)

    used over a blurred color background. This is because it creates an impactful
    button with very few elements to it, creating a transparent control and making
    great use of the white space in the design. In design, especially when designing
    flat, remember that less is more.

    but rounded and it works great with rounded-corner shapes such as the ones we
