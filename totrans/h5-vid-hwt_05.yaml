    days, developers were forced to use technology like CGI scripts to submit forms
    and completely redraw the results page. It was only then, after the page had been
    submitted to the server, that the user had any idea of their information was accepted.
    If it wasn't, they had to start over again.
  prefs: []

    challenges when JavaScript was turned off or accessibility was a requirement.

    to the server or relying on JavaScript. Though not as robust as an AJAX solution,

    value for the range input tag. Here's hoping that as HTML5 gets further defined
    and more browsers support its native controls, we'll be able to better control
    that. Until then, use with caution.

    cool thing about `<input type="range" />:` Like `<input type="email" />` and `<input
    type="URL" />` and `<input type="number" />`, other browsers support it! Well,
    sort of. Like those tags, even browsers that don't understand `<input type="range"
    />` (Firefox, I'm lookin' at you!) will default back to `<input type="text" />`,
    so it still works. Brilliant!
