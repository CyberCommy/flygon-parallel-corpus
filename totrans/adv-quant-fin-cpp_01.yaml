- en: Quantitative Finance studies the application of quantitative techniques to the
    solution of problems in finance. It spans diverse areas such as the management
    of investment funds and insurance companies, the control of financial risks for
    manufacturing companies and banking industry, and the behavior of the financial
    markets. Quantitative Finance is eminently interdisciplinary building upon key
    expertise from the disciplines of finance, mathematics, and informatics.

- en: In general, a financial derivative is a contract between two parties who agree
    to exchange one or more cash flows in the future. The value of these cash flows
    depends on some future event, for example, that the value of some stock index
    or interest rate being above or below some predefined level. The activation or
    triggering of this future event thus depends on the behavior of a variable quantity
    known as **the underlying**. Financial derivatives receive their name because
    they derive their value from the behavior of another financial instrument.

    are probabilistic and not deterministic. The future cash flows in a derivative
    contract are contingent on some future event. That is why derivatives are also
    known as **contingent claims**. This feature makes these types of contracts difficult
    to price.

    agrees to buy the underlying from the other party at some predetermined date (the
    maturity date) for some predetermined price (the delivery price). An example could
    be a one-month forward contract on one ounce of silver. The underlying is the
    price of one ounce of silver. No exchange of cash flows occur at inception (today,
    *t=0*), but it occurs only at maturity (*t=T*). Here *t* represents the variable
    time. Forwards are contracts negotiated privately between two parties (in other
    words, **Over The Counter** (**OTC**)), while futures are negotiated at an exchange.

    asset (the underlying) for some particular price (the strike price) at some particular
    date in the future (the maturity date). This type of contract is called a **European

- en: An **Interest Rate Swap** (**IRS**) is a financial contract between two parties
    A and B who agree to exchange cash flows at regular intervals during a given period
    of time (the life of a contract). Typically, the cash flows from A to B are indexed
    to a fixed rate of interest, while the cash flows from B to A are indexed to a
    floating interest rate. The set of fixed cash flows is known as the **fixed leg**,
    while the set of floating cash flows is known as the **floating leg**. The cash
    flows occur at regular intervals during the life of the contract between inception
    (*t=0*) and maturity (*t=T*). An example could be a fixed-for-floating IRS, who
    pays a rate of 5 percent on the agreed notional *N* every three months and receives
    EURIBOR3M on the agreed notional *N* every three months.

- en: What is the role of C++ in pricing derivatives? Its role is fundamental. It
    allows us to implement the actual calculations that are required in order to solve
    the pricing problem. Using the preceding techniques to describe the dynamics of
    the underlying, we require to simulate many potential future scenarios describing
    its evolution. Say we ought to price a futures contract on the EUR/USD exchange
    rate with one year maturity. We have to simulate the future evolution of EUR/USD
    for each day for the next year (using equation 3). We can then compute the payoff
    at maturity (using equation 1). However, in order to compute the expected payoff
    (using equation 4), we need to simulate thousands of such possible evolutions
    via a technique known as **Monte Carlo simulation**. The set of steps required
    to complete this process is known as an **algorithm**. To price a derivative,
    we ought to construct such algorithm and then implement it in an advanced programming
    language such as C++. Of course C++ is not the only possible choice, other languages
    include Java, VBA, C#, Mathworks Matlab, and Wolfram Mathematica. However, C++
    is an industry standard because it's flexible, fast, and portable. Also, through
    the years, several numerical libraries have been created to conduct complex numerical
    calculations in C++. Finally, C++ is a powerful modern object-oriented language.
