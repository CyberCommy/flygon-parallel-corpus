- en: This is an **up-to-date** book about Kubernetes. It’s relatively short, and
    it’s straight-to-the-point. The idea is that you can read it in a couple of days!
    No prior knowledge required.

    a deep dive!** It covers the most important aspects of Kubernetes. And I think
    it’s the best book on the market for getting up-to-speed fast!

    However, Kindle is notoriously bad at synchronizing updates. If you have problems
    getting updates to your Kindle, contact Kindle Support and they will resolve the
    issue.

    is lonely work. I literally spent months making this book as great as possible,
    so a couple of minutes of your time for a review would be great. No pressure though,
    I won’t lose any sleep if you don’t.

- en: Kubernetes is white-hot, and Kubernetes skills are in high demand. So, if you
    want to push ahead with your career and work with a technology that’s shaping
    the future, you need to read this book. If you don’t care about your career and
    are fine being left behind, don’t read it. It’s the truth.

- en: Kubernetes is Kubernetes. So you there’s obviously some similar content between
    my books and video courses. But reading books and watching videos are totally
    different experiences. In my opinion, videos are more fun, but books are easier
    to write notes in and flick through when you’re trying to find something.

    inversely proportional to how old it is! In other words, the older this book is,
    the less valuable it is. With this in mind, **I’m committed to at least one update
    a year** . And when I say “updates”, I mean real updates - every word and concept
    is reviewed, and every example is tested and updated. **I’m 100% committed to
    this book!**

    welcome to the new normal!

    at the discounted price of $2.99\. This is done via the *Kindle Matchbook* program.
    Unfortunately, Kindle Matchbook is only available in the US, and it’s buggy -
    sometimes the Kindle Matchbook icon doesn’t appear on the book’s Amazon selling
    page. Contact Kindle Support if you have issues like this and they’ll sort you
    out.
