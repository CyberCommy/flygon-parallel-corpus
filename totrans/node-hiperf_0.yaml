- en: High performance on a platform such as Node.js means knowing how to take advantage
    of every aspect of your hardware and helping memory management act at its best
    and correctly decide how to architect a complex application. Do not panic if your
    application starts consuming a lot of memory. Instead, spot the leak and solve
    it fast. Better yet, monitor and stop it before it becomes an issue.

- en: '[Chapter 1](ch01.html "Chapter 1. Introduction and Composition"), *Introduction
    and Composition*, introduces the subject, emphasizing performance analysis and
    the importance of benchmarking. It''s about splitting applications into several
    smaller components, reducing the complexity of each component to a manageable
    level for the developers involved in the application. Here, you understand the
    importance of developing methodologies to break complexity into smaller and reusable
    modules that can more easily be analyzed and exchanged with other new and better
    modules during the course of the application''s life cycle.'

- en: '[Chapter 2](ch02.html "Chapter 2. Development Patterns"), *Development Patterns*,
    is about good programming patterns that help avoid performance penalties or help
    find them. You''ll value the importance of carefully choosing techniques and patterns
    that are simple, and avoid future problems. With this in mind, you''ll better
    understand how the language works, the importance of knowing the event loop, how
    asynchronous programming works best, and some of the first-class citizens of the
    language—streams and buffers.'

- en: '[Chapter 3](ch03.html "Chapter 3. Garbage Collection"), *Garbage Collection*,
    covers GC, its importance, and its behavior. Here, you get to understand V8 memory
    management, dead memory, and memory leaks. You also learn how to profile an application
    and spot memory leaks caused by bad programming where a developer hasn''t deferenced
    objects correctly.'

- en: '[Chapter 4](ch04.html "Chapter 4. CPU Profiling"), *CPU Profiling*, is about
    profiling the processor and understanding when and why your application hogs your
    host. In this chapter, you understand the limits of the language and how to develop
    applications that can be divided into several components running across different
    hosts, allowing better performance and scalability.'

- en: '[Chapter 5](ch05.html "Chapter 5. Data and Cache"), *Data and Cache*, explains
    externally stored application data and how it can affect your application''s performance.
    It''s about data stored locally in the application, the disk, a local service,
    a local network service or even the client host. In this chapter, you get to know
    that different types of data storage methods have different penalties, and these
    must be considered when choosing the best one. You learn that data can be stored
    locally or remotely and access to the data can be—and should be—cached sometimes,
    depending on the importance of the data.'

- en: '[Chapter 6](ch06.html "Chapter 6. Test, Benchmark, and Analyze"), *Test, Benchmark,
    and Analyze*, is about testing and benchmarking applications. It''s also about
    enforcing code coverage to avoid unknown application test zones. Then we cover
    benchmarks and benchmark analytics. You get to understand how good tests can pinpoint
    where to benchmark and analyze specific parts of the application to allow performance
    improvements.'

- en: '[Chapter 7](ch07.html "Chapter 7. Bottlenecks"), *Bottlenecks*, covers limits
    outside the application. This chapter is about the situations when you realize
    that the performance limit is not because of the application programing but external
    factors, such as the host hardware, network or client. You''ll become aware of
    the limits that external components can impose on the application, locally or
    remotely. Moreover, the chapter explains that sometimes, the limits are on the
    client side and nothing can be done to improve the current performance.'

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The only software needed is Node.js. Some modules might need compilation, so
    a Linux or OS X operating system is easier for testing of the examples. No specific
    hardware is needed.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The book is intended for those with a basic Node.js background and those in
    need of a more in-depth understanding of this platform. Maybe, you're comfortable
    with the language and perhaps you know that it has a garbage collector, but you
    never really understand how it works and how it fails to work depending on the
    way you use the language. Basic language understanding and solid experience are
    required.
