- en: The evolution of software means that systems are getting bigger and more complex,
    making some of the traditional techniques for dealing with them ineffective. The
    microservice architecture has gained traction in recent years as an effective
    technique for dealing with complex web services and allowing more people to work
    on the same system without interfering with one another. In a nutshell, it creates
    small web services where each one solves a specific problem, and they all coordinate
    together through well-defined APIs.

- en: In this book, we will explain in detail the microservice architecture and how
    to successfully run it, enabling you to understand the architecture at a technical
    level as well as understand the implications of the architecture for teams and
    their workloads.

    monolith that needs to be moved to a microservice architecture. This example is
    described in [Chapter 1](ddb0a00a-6c5b-4ffe-b403-0f5f9f7a7df2.xhtml), *Making
    the Move – Design, Plan, Execute*, and is then continued throughout the rest of
    the book.

- en: This book is aimed at developers or software architects who work with complex
    systems and want to be able to scale the development of their systems.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It is also aimed at developers who typically deal with a monolith that has grown
    to a point where adding new features is difficult and development is difficult
    to scale. The book outlines the migration of a traditional monolithic system to
    a microservice architecture, providing a roadmap covering all the different stages.
