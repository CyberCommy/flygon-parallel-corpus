    covered it all. However, to achieve best practices with Metasploit, we must know
    tips and tricks to make the most of the Metasploit framework. In this chapter,
    we will cover some quick tips and scripts that will aid penetration testing with
    Metasploit. In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:'

- en: The **Social Engineering Toolkit** (**SET**) is a Python-based set of tools
    that target the human side of penetration testing. We can use SET to perform phishing
    attacks, web jacking attacks that involve victim redirection stating that the
    original website has moved to a different place, file format-based exploits that
    target particular software for exploitation of the victim's system, and many others.
    The best thing about using SET is the menu-driven approach, which will set up
    quick exploitation vectors in no time.
