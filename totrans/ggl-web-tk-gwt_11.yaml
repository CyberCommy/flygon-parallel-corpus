- en: Download the ZIP file that contains the source code for our samples from the
    website for this book ([http://www.packtpub.com/support](http://www.packtpub.com/support)).
    Unzip them to your hard disk. There should be two directories—`Samples` and `Widgets`—created
    when you unzip the file. These two directories contain the source code for the
    applications that we have developed in this book.

    **Window** | **Preferences** | **Java** | **Build Path** | **Classpath Variables**.
    Add a new variable entry named `GWT_HOME` and set it to the directory where you
    have unzipped the GWT distribution, for example: `C:\gwt-windows-1.3.1`. This
    ensures that the GWT JAR files will be available to the samples project.'

    import an existing project into Eclipse by going to **File** | **Import** | **Existing
    projects into Workspace** and then selecting the root directory for the project.
    The `Widgets` project is used for creating the two widgets that are packaged up
    in a JAR file and used by the `Samples` project. It therefore does not define
    an entry point. All you need to do is run/debug the `Samples` project.

    and select `Samples`. This will start up the familiar GWT shell and launch the
    hosted browser with the `Samples` application.

    build the application and create a WAR file that can be used for deployment to
    a servlet container such as Tomcat.

    to run the application from a console on Windows.
