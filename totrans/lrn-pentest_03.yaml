    choice. Kali Linux has a variety of installation options, so we will explore what
    options exist and examine how to use them. After demonstrating the installation
    process, there are some initial tasks that need to be done on Kali Linux, so we
    will work through the initial setup to ensure that we are ready to start working
    with Kali Linux. Scripting should already be part of your arsenal, so we will
    dive into basic scripting and then start exploring some of the common tools that
    are available on Kali Linux.
