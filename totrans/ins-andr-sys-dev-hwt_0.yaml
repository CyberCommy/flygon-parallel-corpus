- en: Welcome to *Instant Android Systems Development How-to*. This book provides
    a gentle introduction to the Android Operating System internals. If you've ever
    wondered about how Android works under the hood, then this book is for you. I
    have often wondered about this question, and I had to spend hours digging through
    thousands of lines of code to understand what Android really is. This book is
    a collection of my experiences working with this platform for more than three
    years now, and I hope it will ease the learning curve of Android systems development.
    Readers can instead focus on the core concepts and get started on building useful
    Android modifications in a short span of time. This book will get you started
    on building you own Android version. The book is comprehensive as it covers every
    aspect of Android systems development, right from downloading the source code,
    to flashing custom-built code on real devices.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Building Android* gets you up to speed on downloading the Android source code
    and building it. This is a rite of passage for many aspiring Android systems developers,
    and this recipe will help you along that journey.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Source code organization and system startup* is explained, as the Android
    code base is huge and effective development includes knowing your way around this
    code. The initial parts of these recipes introduce the reader to various parts
    of the source code. The later parts of these recipes describe in detail how Android
    boots.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Common design patterns in Android systems development* covers the common patterns
    of systems code in Android. Knowing these patterns is crucial to developing high
    quality code. It also saves effort by describing several best practices.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Creating system servers* recipes guide you through a complete example of creating
    a custom system server, which is one of the most basic design patterns in Android
    systems development. Everything from creating a basic interface file to adding
    the code to the existing bootup sequence is covered.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Analyzing Android system partitions* explains the organization of system partitions
    on the Android emulator and several real devices. This knowledge is a prerequisite
    for learning how to correctly flash new OS builds to devices safely.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Compiling for a specific device* understands that most readers will want to
    test their code in real devices; however, getting a build right for a particular
    device takes some experimentation and risk. This recipe aims to eliminate that
    risk by guiding the reader through well-defined steps to get a correct build.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Flashing with Fastboot* is the most common and preferred method of flashing
    new OS builds to devices. This recipe guides readers through the process of installing
    custom-built code on to a device without the risk of breaking it.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Creating the class library* is aimed at readers who wish to ship their customizations.
    One common way to do this is to use class libraries as a frontend to system servers.
    This recipe describes that process with a detailed example. It also covers the
    process of building a custom SDK with new class libraries.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Building apps against a new SDK* jumps on to the next logical question from
    the previous recipe, which is: How do I actually use these new classes in a normal
    development workflow? This recipe answers the question of how to build apps with
    custom-built SDK versions.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Platform Libraries* introduces the reader to yet another design pattern—Platform
    Libraries. This is a Google-recommended technique of including additional code
    into the Android base without modifying core framework files unless one absolutely
    needs to.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Native code for system servers* describes how it is possible to have native
    components in Java-based system servers. This is one of the advanced recipes and
    explains how native code is added to a system server.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Analyzing the ActivityManagerService* delves into the mechanics of how certain
    core system servers work on Android. This is crucial for any reader who wishes
    to modify core framework files. We go through several important facets of probably
    one of the most important system servers in this recipe, including how to add
    a new method to the Activity Manager service.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Adding custom permissions to the framework* is a very important recipe that
    describes how to correctly secure code added by a reader. It describes the Android
    permission framework and explains how to extend it to accommodate additional permissions.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Analyzing the PackageManagerService* continues with our analysis of core services
    by looking at the `PackageManagerService` class, which is central to all code
    that is installed on a device and all permission checks.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Modifying system applications* explains that because Android ships with a
    number of standard system apps, you may sometimes need to add extra functionality
    to these applications and this recipe teaches the reader exactly that.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Tips and tricks for faster builds* gives us some pointers on how to speed
    up Android source code builds, which can otherwise be quite painful as they tend
    to take a lot of time.'

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You will require a modern 64 bit computer with any flavor of Ubuntu (preferably
    10.04, 10.10, or 11.10) installed. More RAM is always good, but no less than 4
    GB. To flash code to devices, you will also require one of Google's Developer
    Phones.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book is primarily intended at systems developers who wish to get started
    with Android systems code. Thus, some familiarity with Linux systems code is assumed.
    However, it can also be used by Android SDK developers who wish to learn how Android
    works internally so that they can write better apps. Finally, the curious reader
    is always a part of the intended audience.
