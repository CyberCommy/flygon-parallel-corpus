- en: Who doesn't have an idea for the next great app or service they want to launch?
    However, most apps, services, and websites ultimately rely on a server being able
    to accept requests and then create, read, update, and delete records based on
    those requests. Django makes it easy to build and launch websites, services, and
    backends for your great idea. However, despite the history of being used at large-scale
    successful start-ups and enterprises, it can be difficult to gather all the resources
    necessary to actually take an idea from empty directory to running production
    server.

- en: Over the course of three projects, *Building Django Web Applications* guides
    you from an empty directory to creating full-fledged apps to replicate the core
    functionality of some of the web's most popular web apps. In Part 1, you'll make
    your own online movie database. In Part 2, you'll make a website letting users
    ask and answer questions. In Part 3, you'll make a web app to manage mailing lists
    and send emails. All three projects culminate in your deploying the project to
    a server so that you can see your ideas come to life. Between starting each project
    and deploying it, we'll cover important practical concepts such as how to build
    APIs, secure your project, add search using Elasticsearch, use caching, and offload
    tasks to worker process to help your project scales.
