- en: Android is the most popular platform for mobile devices. Every year, there are
    more and more developers getting involved in Android development. The Android
    Framework makes it possible to develop applications for mobile phones, tablets,
    televisions, and much more! So far, all development has been done in Java. Recently,
    Google announced Kotlin as the second language developers can use. Because of
    this, and with Kotlin's ever-growing popularity, we decided to introduce you to
    Android using Kotlin as its primary development programming language.

- en: With Kotlin, you can do everything you can do with Java, but with more joy and
    fun! We will show you how to play with Android and Kotlin, and how to create amazing
    things! Thanks to Kotlin, it's certain that the Android platform will evolve even
    more. In the near future, it's not impossible that Kotlin will become the primary
    development language for the platform. Take your seat and get ready for a great
    journey!
