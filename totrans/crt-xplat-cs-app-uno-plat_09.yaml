- en: This final part of the book focuses on app development after the code has been
    written. Specifically, it focuses on how you can test the UI of the apps you create
    and then deploy them to the cloud (in the case of WebAssembly) or an app store.
    Finally, it shows you where to go for more resources, help, or information, before
    ending by looking at how you can contribute to the wider project.
