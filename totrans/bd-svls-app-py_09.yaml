    them. We  learned about the various functionalities available, along with the
    available triggers for the Python runtime. We also learned and experimented with
    the logging and monitoring capabilities of Microsoft Azure Functions along with
    understanding and experimenting with the experimental features of Azure such as
    the additional runtimes apart from the standard set of languages it offers out
    of the box.
