- en: In this section, we'll take what we've learned about clean code and JavaScript's
    language constructs and apply this in order to build clean and coherent JavaScript
    abstractions. By doing this, we'll learn how to design intuitive abstractions
    using well-known patterns, how to think about common JavaScript problem domains,
    how to deal with error states, and how to work effectively with the sometimes
    awkward DOM API.
