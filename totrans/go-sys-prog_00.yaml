- en: '*Go Systems Programming* is a book that will help you develop systems software
    using Go, which is a systems programming language that started as an internal
    Google project before becoming popular. What makes Go really popular is that it
    keeps the developer happy by being easy to write, easy to read, easy to understand,
    and by having a compiler that is there to help you. This book does not cover every
    possible aspect and feature of the Go programming language: only the ones that
    are related to systems programming. Should you wish to learn more about the Go
    programming language, you should wait from my next book, *Mastering Go*, which
    will be ready in 2018!'

- en: The book you are about to read is an honest book in the sense that it will present
    working Go code without overlooking its potential faults, its restrictions, and
    its logical gaffes, which will allow you to improve it on your own and create
    a better version of it in the future. What you will not be able to improve is
    the fundamental information that will be presented, which is the basis of the
    way Unix systems work. I will consider the book to be successful if it helps you
    understand what systems programming is about, why it is important, and how you
    can start developing systems software in Go. I will be equally happy if Go becomes
    your favorite programming language!

    Go and Unix Systems Programming*, starts by defining what systems programming
    is before talking about the advantages and the disadvantages of Go, the features
    of Go version 1.8, two handy Go tools named `gofmt` and `godoc`, as well as the
    various states of Unix processes.'

    in Go*, helps you learn how to compile Go code and how to use the environment
    variables that Go supports, and understand how Go reads the command line arguments
    of a program. Then, we will talk about getting user input and output, which are
    fundamental tasks, show you how to define functions in Go, where the `defer` keyword
    is mentioned for the first time in this book and continue by discussing the data
    structures that Go offers using handy code examples. In the remaining sections
    of the chapter, we will discuss Go interfaces and random number generation. I
    am sure that you are going to enjoy this chapter!'

    goes deeper and starts talking about some advanced Go features, including error
    handling, which is critical when developing systems software and error logging.
    Then it introduces you to pattern matching and regular expressions, Go Reflection,
    and talks about unsafe code. After that, it compares Go to other programming languages
    and presents two utilities, named `dtrace(1)` and `strace(1)`, that allow you
    to see what happens behind the scenes when you execute a program. Lastly, it talks
    about how you can use the `go tool` to detect unreachable code and how to avoid
    some common Go mistakes.'

    function, which requires Go version 1.8 or newer. Then it shows Go implementations
    of a linked list, a binary tree and a hash table. After that, it discusses Go
    packages and teaches you how to create and use your own Go packages. The last
    part of the chapter discusses Garbage collection in Go.'

    which is the handling of files, symbolic links, and directories. In this chapter,
    you will find Go implementations of the core functionality of Unix tools such
    as `which(1)`, `pwd(1)`, and `find(1)`, but first you will learn how to use the
    `flag` package in order to parse the command-line arguments and options of a Go
    program. Additionally, you will learn how to delete, rename, and move files as
    well as how to traverse directory structures the Go way. The last part of this
    chapter implements a utility that creates a copy of all the directories of a directory
    structure!'

    your own data to files! In this chapter, you will learn about the `io` package,
    the `io.Writer` and `io.Reader` interfaces, and the `bufio` package that is used
    for buffered input and output. You will also create Go versions of the `cp(1)`,
    `wc(1)`, and `dd(1)` utilities. Lastly, you will learn about sparse files, how
    to create sparse files in Go, how to read and write records from files, and how

    data to Unix log files, appending data to existing files, and altering the data
    of text files. In this chapter, you will also learn about the log and `log/syslog`
    standard Go packages, about Unix file permissions, and take your pattern matching
    and regular expressions knowledge even further using practical examples. You will
    also learn about finding the user ID of a user as well as the Unix groups a user
    belongs to. Lastly, you will discover how to work with dates and times in Go using
    the `time` package and how to create and rotate log files on your own.'

    package by presenting three Go programs. Then it shows a Go program that can rotate
    its log files using signals and signal handling and another Go program that uses
    signals to present the progress of a file copy operation. This chapter will also
    teach you how to plot data in Go and how to implement Unix pipes in Go. Then it
    will implement the `cat(1)` utility in Go before briefly presenting the Go code
    of a Unix socket client. The last section of the chapter quickly discusses how

    about how you can create goroutines and how you can synchronize them and wait
    for them to finish before ending a program. Then it talks about channels and pipelines,
    which help goroutines communicate and exchange data in a safe way. The last part
    of the chapter presents a version of the `wc(1)` utility that is implemented using
    goroutines. However, as goroutines is a big subject, the next chapter will continue

    including buffered channels, signal channels, nil channels, channels of channels,
    timeouts, and the `select` keyword. Then it discusses issues related to shared
