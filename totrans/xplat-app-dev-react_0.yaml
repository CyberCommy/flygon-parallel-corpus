- en: React Native helps web and mobile developers to build cross-platform apps that
    perform at the same level as any other natively developed app. The range of apps
    that can be built using this library is huge. From e-commerce to games, React
    Native is a good fit for any mobile project due to its flexibility and extendable
    nature. There's no doubt React Native is not only a good alternative to native
    development, but also a great way to introduce web developers to a mobile project.
