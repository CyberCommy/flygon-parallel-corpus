- en: It would seem that everything that needs to be written about JavaScript has
    been written. Frankly, it is difficult to find a topic related to JavaScript that
    has not been discussed ad nauseam. However, JavaScript is changing at a rapid
    pace. ECMAScript 6 has the potential to transform the language and how we code
    in it. Node.js has already changed the way in which we write servers in JavaScript.
    Newer ideas such as React and Flux will drive the next iteration of the language.
    While we spend our time learning the new features, there is no denying that the
    foundational ideas of JavaScript have to be mastered. These ideas are fundamental
    and need attention. If you are already an experienced JavaScript developer, you
    will realize that modern JavaScript is vastly different from the language that
    most people have known. Modern JavaScript demands a specific stylistic discipline
    and rigor of thought. Tools are more powerful and slowly becoming an integral
    part of the development workflow. Though the language seems to be changing, it
    is built on some very solid and constant ideas. This course emphasizes on these
    fundamental ideas.

    number of chapters. The first half of the module, which we'll refer to as Part
    1, covers the classical design patterns, which are found in the GoF book. Part
    2 looks at patterns that are either not covered in the GoF book or that are specific
    to JavaScript.

    1")*,* Mastering JavaScript, This module will be your companion as you master
    JavaScript and build innovative web applications. To begin with, you will get
    familiarized with the language constructs and how to make code easy to organize.
    You will gain a concrete understanding of variable scoping, loops, and best practices
    on using types and data structures, as well as the coding style and recommended
    code organization patterns in JavaScript. This module will also teach you how
    to use arrays and objects as data structures. You will graduate from intermediate-level
    skills to advanced techniques as you come to understand crucial language concepts
    and design principles. You will learn about modern libraries and tools so you
    can write better code. By the end of the module, you will understand how reactive
    JavaScript is going to be the new paradigm.'

    you will explore how design patterns can help you improve and organize your JavaScript
    code. You''ll get to grips with creational, structural and behavioral patterns
    as you discover how to put them to work in different scenarios. Then, you''ll
    get a deeper look at patterns used in functional programming, as well as model
    view patterns and patterns to build web applications. You will also delve into
    reactive design patterns and microservices as they are a growing phenomenon in
    the world of web development. You will also find patterns to improve the testability
    of your code using mock objects, mocking frameworks, and monkey patching. We''ll
    also show you some advanced patterns including dependency injection and live post
    processing. By the end of the module, you''ll be saved of a lot of trial and error
    and developmental headaches, and you will be on the road to becoming a JavaScript
    expert.'

    3")*,* Modern JavaScript Applications, In this module, we begin by creating a
    single page application that builds on the innovative MVC approach using AngularJS,
    then move forward to develop an enterprise-level application with the microservices
    architecture using Node to build web services. After that, shift your focus to
    network programming concepts as you build a real-time web application with websockets.
    Learn to build responsive, declarative UIs with React and Bootstrap, and see how
    the performance of web applications can be enhanced using Functional Reactive
    Programming (FRP). Along the way, explore how the power of JavaScript can be increased
    multi-fold with high performance techniques. By the end of the module, you''ll
    be a skilled JavaScript developer with a solid knowledge of the latest JavaScript
    techniques, tools, and architecture to build modern web apps.'

    all modern browsers. There are standalone JavaScript engines written in C++ (V8)
    and Java (Rhino), and these are used to power all sorts of tools, such as Node.js,
    CouchDB, and even Elasticsearch. These patterns can be applied to any of these
