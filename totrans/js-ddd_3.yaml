    We focused on creating a mental model for ourselves and confirmed that our understanding
    of the domain matched the understanding of our domain expert. By doing this, we
    started to create a shared language between all the people involved so that all
    parties can communicate about the project while avoiding most misunderstandings.
    With all this in place, we were able to identify a starting point for the project,
    and now that we know where to start and how to name our objects according to the
    domain, we can set up the project to fit this. Robert C. Martin says in his talk
    *Architecture the lost years*: *Architecture is about intent* that architecture
    is not created for the sake of itself but actually to state what the project is
    about and make it clear for the next person what each level covers. As we set
    up our application, we want to express what the application is about at every
    level, and this includes the level of organization of files and folders as much
    as it is about creating classes and modules.'

    has been to not make decisions prematurely as well as to ensure the decisions
    we make are as self-explanatory as possible. We have not decided on any frameworks
    or actually any technology yet, but as we now push our application forward, it
    is time to resolve some of those deferred decisions, even though we want to keep
    as much as possible open to change.

    embrace a change of structure. This is important to keep in mind throughout the

    our refactoring, or making our project more rigid because of an overwhelming class

    a language used for large applications, be it in the browser or on the server,
    the need for more involved architectures has grown and people have tried to carry
    over many of the concepts currently in use for Java or C++ backend applications.
    Often this actually causes more problems than it solves, as JavaScript is a very
    flexible language and has its own concepts of how organization can, and should,
    be done even though parts might still be missing; modules being one of those as
    a core concept. When building a JavaScript application, always keep in mind what
    language you are using and use its features and concepts to work with your project;
    don't fight it every step of the way.

    to see is the layout of files and folders in the project. This is also the element
    of organization we deal with constantly while editing the project, so it is worth
    investing thought into the organization. Just looking at the files and folders
    should already tell you something about the project; it is the highest level of
    organization and therefore should represent some of the top level concepts of
    our domain.

- en: As a new developer joins a project, or even as one comes back to a project that
    they have not been recently working on, there is a learning curve in knowing where
    things are located, and maybe even more importantly in where things should be
    located moving forward. This is always a problem as it slows down development,
    or when talking about an open source project it might actually slow down adoption
    and contributions. So we obviously want to make codebase as approachable as possible,
    but what does this mean? There is a subjective learning curve in relation to unfamiliar
    tools and styles, which is hard to estimate ahead of time for each developer,
    but there is also a more objective one in relation to common practices, naming,
    and well established concepts. So how can we make a codebase approachable just
    from the file and folder level?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When we start out, we will need to take a look at what is in there, so the ease
    of navigation is one of the first things we have to deal with. Having extensive
    levels of subfolders, with only view files, or sometimes even no files, is an
    example of making a project hard to navigate. Some might say that the editor you
    are working with should solve this, but it is also a problem we create for ourselves,
    so we should refrain from it.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are more ways to make a project approachable so, for example, the filenames
    should reflect the contents, as should the directory names, and probably most
    importantly, the project should follow conventions that have been established
    in the community. This means that unless you have a very good reason, you should
    refrain from creating your own conventions. Especially little things such as naming
    files according to a community standard can help a lot. One example is tagging
    on names like model or controller to the end of files. In some programming communities
    this is really common, while in the Node.js community it is frowned upon. Following
    these little things can make it easier for developers as not following them might
    almost drive rage towards a project.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Keep in mind that files will most likely only ever be touched by developers,
    so they can be optimized to support developers in their task, and so a common
    developer practice is of higher weight than approachability for a domain expert.
    Of course, the extent of this varies between projects and tasks. It holds largely
    true for the organizational nature and for common idioms from frameworks, but
    does not extend to the naming of the inherent part of the language that is developed
    throughout the project. We want the project's structure to be approachable for
    developers already familiar with similar codebases, but we don't want to introduce
    a translation layer between the developers and the domain experts.

    of node modules all the way while already hinting at a possible structure to include
    multiple features outside the prisoner transfer. The `index.js` files are conventional
    named to indicate the entry point to a certain module. A developer jumping into
    the project will know to look in those files first when trying to find out more
    about the module. We can leverage this fact later to include common documentation
    about the feature, as well as having this file load all the others necessary to
    accomplish the module task.

- en: Creating the tests in a test folder is also the established way to locate your
    tests. As the test have certain categories inherent in their design, it makes
    sense to structure the test directory accordingly. The structure of the test folder
    should allow us to, at a glance, figure out what tests there are and how they
    apply to our project as a whole. As the project grows, having a set of tests covering
    the features is not only incredibly valuable from a regression perspective, but
    also gives a quick insight into how a certain feature can be used, so locating
    your tests quickly can mean a certain module gets reused or adapted instead of
    wasting efforts on duplicating what was there already.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As developers are working on the project, they are most likely working on either
    a feature, or are fixing bugs and refactoring code. As these activities are, at
    least in the case we are aiming for, related to one feature, we want to make sure
    that the developer does not have to jump into many different places to edit. The
    files related to the problem should therefore be in one spot, reducing the overhead
    of opening everything related to a given task or feature, as well as the mental
    overhead of keeping the related parts in one's head to make sure the edits happen
    in the right place.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is one of the reasons we created features such as packages or modules in
    the `lib` folder before. As the developer works on the prisoner transfer, they
    can, just by looking at the directory structure, know what to edit. They can quickly
    open the files in their editor and view them as a unit of work as they are changing
    the code to accomplish a given task.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Using a structure like this not only makes it easier to look at for the developer
    when editing, but also the version control system will be easier to work with.
    As the code is organized like this, we can look at it on a feature-by-feature
    basis and we are also less likely to touch the same files when working on different
    features. This not only reduces the likelihood of conflict, but also makes the
    history of a given module more useful.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you look at the preceding structure we have been using so far, you might
    have noticed that the locality of edits breaks down for tests. As we work on the
    prisoner transfer feature in `lib`, we have to edit the feature test in tests
    as well, which is about as far apart as you can get filesystem-wise. As with everything
    in software development, this is a tradeoff and we have chosen approachability
    over locality in this case. The reason being that a higher value is placed on
    the onboarding of people, and the assumed cost of non-locality seems low enough
    to support that. If we think otherwise, we might locate the tests for each feature
    inside the feature, and therefore more easily enable moving the whole feature
    to a different project in the future. This decision is not all or nothing of course,
    and we might create a structure resembling the main structure under the test directory
    to keep a locality for the tests as part of the tests directory for example.

    of its usage, and the best software is the kind that grows beyond its intended
    use case. A common example is Unix and the associated philosophy. The idea is
    to create many small pieces that, when recombined, allow for a vast variety of
    uses. Unix has survived in various forms for decades now and there does not seem
    to be an end in sight, but being created in a certain way is only half the story.
    As changes came along and new use cases took form, it did not ossify, but its
    idea and concepts were malleable, but what does that mean for our software. How
    can we achieve similar versatility?
  prefs: []

    of modules. There is an obvious distinction between the different elements as
    features are implemented. From a fitness perspective, this means that we are quickly
    able to locate a certain feature, as well as enhance, remove, or reuse it. A feature
    should also hint at its dependencies, which could be made clear through subfolders,
    or just by looking at the imported dependencies located in the index file located
    right at the root of a feature directory.

- en: To give an example, moving forward as the dungeon manager grows, the prisoner
    transfer might start to incorporate more messaging since other dungeons have adopted
    our system, and we can now fully automate transfers between them. At this point,
    the whole kingdom relies on the availability of the transfer service and this
    means that very rigorous testing needs to be present to ensure its reliability
    because downtime means that the kingdom cannot raid at maximum effectiveness.
    We are very happy with the success of this system, but it slows down development
    of the dungeon manager in general, as the prisoner transfer is a part of it and
    we need to comply with its harsh integration rules. But we are in a good position
    after all; if we look at the layout of our application, we can see that we can
    quite easily extract the prisoner transfer into an application by itself and have
    it maintained separately.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: After the extraction, we can start moving forward quickly again, and integrate
    the transfer as just another service the dungeon manager speaks with. Splitting
    out common functionality, as well as functionality that has to comply with different
    constraints, is key to having malleable and extendable software that can keep
    moving forward.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In reality, this would obviously be the best case, but just structuring an application
    as a set of independent small parts all tested separately on the feature level
    makes us consider APIs in a way that will be very useful down the road as the
    software grows and, of course, the same goes the other way around. We are able
    to rip out unneeded features quickly and thus reduce the maintenance overhead
    and increase our velocity. This is in essence the concept of cooperation of all
    the small Unix programs mentioned at the beginning of this section.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is not the *be all and end all* of software design of course, as anybody
    who started out using Unix mainly from the shell will know that the initial learning
    curve is rather steep and getting anything done does not feel very fast or expressive
    at the beginning. As we have seen before, reaching all the way for one goal means
    sacrificing another, in this example—the approachability of the project. After
    all, there is no perfect solution, but at least at the beginning of a project
    it is often helpful to enhance approachability and think about other problems
    as they arise. For us, this means that keeping a high level structure of modules
    in mind is probably a good thing, but going overboard and making every piece ready
    for extraction, or even its own application, will probably not help the project
    along.

    features that might become an independent piece of functionality, but what about
    the other way around? Domains often have a certain set of key concepts that to
    shows up time and time again. This is great as it allows us to not having to write
    it over and over if we can share it across the pieces that need. It also shows
    that we understand the domain well enough to extract core concepts and share them,
    so it is actually something to strive for.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is great on a level where our features match the shared functionality closely;
    we provide a public interface and each dependent interface can develop against
    that. But what happens if we actually extract a piece of functionality, and our
    prisoner transfer service is for example no longer local to the application but
    actually a service that is reachable via HTTP for example? In this case, we have
    to deal with shared functionality, which is not just another thing we can create
    an API for, but we actually have to implement the same code in every dependent
    to actually call over the API to do the work we were doing locally before. Think
    of the payment gateway abstraction every other shopping system creates—this kind
    of functionality could be developed once and used in multiple places, allowing
    shared testing and shared resources for development.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is, of course, not the only place where shared functionality actually means
    there is code being shared, where it seems like we have to duplicate certain snippets
    all over the place. Other examples might be database access, or configuration
    management. What all of this has in common is that it is actually lower level
    code that does not really have a close relationship with the application domain.
    We are dealing with an artifact of the way we like to communicate, and the patterns
    we applied don't support this communication well. We can think about it also in
    the way that the cohesion at a domain level is low, because we are leaking abstractions
    in a way that would for example make us care about the database accessing code
    when we want to deal with a prisoner.

    used in places all over the project. Even though many architecture purists frown
    upon it, it might be the best way to start out. It is better to have a shared
    toolbox separated out than dealing with code duplication later on after all. Many
    popular libraries start this way; think about underscore providing its implementation
    of the *each* construct on top of JavaScript, and dealing with all the different
    versions underneath that a browser implementation might have to care about to
    run all over the world. The following is an example from the `underscore.js` file,

    this approach, there are problems as well. Especially when poorly named, this
    folder or file quickly becomes the dumping ground for all kind of things. It is
    quicker to not think about where something really belongs, and instead just dump
    more into the utilities folder. At least it is in one place now where it can be
    moved and refactored from, so stay positive; it could be worse. In the long run,
    the goal should be to move to an approach where we use object orientation and
    let our tests guide a domain-design from the start. When we look at an application
    and we see a library function like the above being part of the application code
    we know that there is an abstraction missing. Again, it is all tradeoffs all the
    time and the problem with abstractions is that you have to consider them at the

    works. But as developers, we also need to dig a little deeper and work on the
    unit level, exploring the specifics of our code as we write it, or as we design
    the algorithm. Finally, a project should not only care about its functionality
    in actually doing what it is supposed to do, but also be usable from a user perspective,
    giving responsive answers and performing well enough overall to not be in the
    way. All of these aspects can be achieved by testing.

    it as accessible as possible for the domain expert to read and understand. The

    support of course. In most projects, this is not the case, and the developers
    end up creating the specification code for Cucumber, as well as its implementation
    as test code. In this case, it is useful to stick with more basic tools, as it
    is a better fit for developers to write tests in a way they are accustomed to
    already. This does not mean Cucumber's idea isn't something to keep in mind. Tests
    should read at a really high level, and should be understandable to reflect what
    the product owner originally intended when describing it to developers, so we
    can detect mismatches together as a team. But, as code is most likely to be read

    do that, then we are really going to encounter some pain sooner or later in other
    development areas as well. This pain is really about high coupling; when we are
    coupling a module too close to other pieces of the system the test will show us.
    In this kind of setup, creating a unit test that is isolated is going to require
    an incredible amount of setup to really make sure we only hit the module by itself,

    interface is exposed, the more likely a breakage is going to occur, but even though
    this is our end goal, don't make the mistake of thinking this should be all the
    unit tests ever do. Often when writing a module of a bigger application, it can
    be immensely useful to explore its logic more deeply, especially when the public
    interface might still be in flux. So write all the tests that reach inside the
    harder parts of the module while developing it, but make sure you remove those

    stakeholders have different needs in performance, and having an application that
    does not satisfy its needs might render it useless to some. So many times apps
    stop being used due to bad performance characteristics even if they supply the
    whole feature set otherwise. Overall, just knowing the deficiencies is half the
    battle. When we at least have an understanding of where time is spent, it is a

    natural separation. This doesn't make sense, the combination of HTML, CSS, and
    the DOM abstraction of JavaScript are a DSL, domain-specific language, to build
    browser interfaces. They provide an abstraction under which the browser implementers
    are free to change their implementation without impacting every website written.
    They therefore isolate the business domain of the browser vendors, displaying
    structured content, from the job of creating the content, most likely your job.

    with saving and loading data. As part of this pattern, we create separate objects
