    best practices. Having programmed computers since 1977 I have attained quite a
    bit of experience in this field. I take great pleasure in teaching people about
    computers and hopefully my ideas will be of some benefit.

    be the last time I promise. Create your backup scripts and make sure they run
    when they are supposed to. But one thing I have not talked about yet is verification
    of the backups. You might have 10 teraquads of backups lying around somewhere,
    but do they actually work? When was the last time you checked?

- en: When using the `tar` command it will report at the end of the run if it encountered
    any issues making the archive. In general if it doesn't show anything amiss the
    backup is probably good. Using `tar` with the `-t (tell)` option, or actually
    extracting it on the local or remote machine, is also a good way to determine
    if the archive was made successfully.

- en: Another common backup mistake is to not copy the file to another computer or
    external device. If you are good at making backups but they are all on the same
    machine eventually the hard drive and/or controller is going to fail. You may
    be able to recover the data but why take the risk? Copy your files to at least
    one external drive and/or computer and be safe.

- en: Using `scp` to a remote computer is a really good idea too and my backup program
    does that every night as well. Here is how to set up unattended `ssh`/`scp`. In
    this case, the root account on machine 1 (M1) will be able to `scp` files to the
    `guest1` account on machine 2 (M2). I do it this way because I always disable
    root access of `ssh`/`scp` for security reasons on all my machines.
  id: totrans-19

    your account this method should work on there as well. I use it all the time and
    it is really convenient. Using this approach you can have a script generate an
    HTML file and then copy it right to your website. Dynamic generation of HTML pages
    is something programs are really good at.

- en: As I mentioned before, I have been working with computers for a really long
    time. I started out using an editor on DOS called Edlin and it was pretty weak
    (but still better than punch cards). I eventually moved on and started using vi
    on AIX (IBM's version of UNIX). I got pretty good at using vi since we didn't
    have any other options yet. As time went on other choices became available and
    I started using the IBM Personal Editors. These were really easy to use, more
    efficient than vi, and had many more features. As I did more and more programming,
    I found that none of these editors could do everything I wanted and so I wrote
    my own in the C programming language. This was a long time ago under DOS, however,
    my editor has now been modified to run on Xenix, OS/2, AIX, Solaris, UNIX, FreeBSD,
    NetBSD, and of course Linux. It also works well on Windows under the Cygwin environment.

    one keystroke.

    across. I will mention that vi is a fine editor and is used with success by probably
    the majority of UNIX/Linux people. However, in my experience if a lot of programming
    is being done the use of a different editor with more features will save you a
    lot of time. It's also quite a bit easier, and that makes the process even more
    fun.

    an `lbcur` alias which puts me into the directory where I am currently working
    on this book. Since I use both my root and `guest1` accounts to write a book,
    I can change the chapter number in just the `source.lbcur.txt` file. I then source
    the `.bashrc` files for root and `guest1` and I'm done. Otherwise, I would have
    to make the change in each `.bashrc` file. With just two files maybe it wouldn't
    be that bad, but suppose you had several users? I use this technique quite a bit
    on my systems as I am a very lazy typist.

    Some of these are logged into the other machines in my house. As of this writing
    I am logged into laptop1, laptop4, and gabi1 (my girlfriend's laptop running Fedora
    20). I found a while back that if the prompt were different on these terminals
    it was harder for me to get mixed up and type the right command but on the wrong
    computer. Needless to say that could be a disaster. For a while I would change
    the prompt manually but that got old very quickly. One day I found almost by accident
    a really cool solution to this problem. I have used this technique on Red Hat
    Enterprise Linux, Fedora, and CentOS and so it should work on your system as well
    (with maybe a little bit of tweaking).

    That string is only in the environment on the local machine. So when you open
    a terminal locally on big1 it uses the normal prompt. However, if you `ssh` to
    another system the string is not there and so it uses the long expanded prompt.

    asked by my manager to take over a project from a fellow worker. He would `zip`
    or `tar` up the files and then give me the archive. I would uncompress it on my
    system and try to begin the work. But there was always a file missing. It would
    often take two, three, or more attempts before I would finally have every file
    needed to compile the project. So, the moral to this story is when making an archive
    to give to someone else make absolutely sure to copy it to another machine and
    test it there. Only then can you be reasonably sure that you have included every
    file.
