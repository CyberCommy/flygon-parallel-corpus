    system, I am going to use **Minimalistic GCC for Windows** (**MinGW**) as my C++
    compiler. For those of you who have not heard about GCC, it is a C/C++ compiler
    that you can find in a Linux operating system and it is included in a Linux distribution
    as well. MinGW is a port of GCC to a Windows environment. Therefore, the entire
    code and examples in this book are applicable to any other GCC flavor.

    separately. Suppose we have many tiny files and we just want to edit a single

    are linked together by a separate program called the linker. The linker combines
    all the object files together to create a single executable file. Using the previous

    two object files and then link them together to produce a single executable file.
