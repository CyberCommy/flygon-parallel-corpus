    help us manipulate views on application state changes and respond to view updates
    with little or no manual interaction with the actual DOM.
  prefs: []

    view. In Angular, when we build UI widgets, we are building components. We have
    already built a lot of them, such as `WorkoutRunner`, `WorkoutAudio`, `WorkoutBuilder`,
    and many more!'

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    building exercise involves manipulating the state of the components/elements on
    which these directives are applied. The `MyAudioDirective` built in [Chapter 3](part0039.xhtml#1565U2-edca168d36254bda8a21f611a95615c3
    "Chapter 3.  More Angular 2 – SPA, Routing, and Data Flows in Depth"), *More Angular
    2 –€“ SPA, Routing, and Data Flows in Depth*, does the same. The directive wraps
    the HTML 5 *audio* element (`HTMLAudioElement`) for easy usage. Platform directives
    such as `ngStyle` and `ngClass` also function in a similar manner.

    view. Instead, they work on the *view template* (HTML fragment) provided to them
    as part of their usage. More often than not, the purpose of a structural directive
    is to show/hide or clone the template view provided to it. Platform directives
    such as `NgFor`, `NgIf`, and `NgSwitch` are the prime examples in this category.'

    we could have built a standard custom validator class. The advantage of creating
    a directive is that it allows us to incorporate the directive in a template-driven
    form approach, where the directive can be embedded in the view HTML. Or, if the
    form has been generated using a model (model-driven approach), we can directly
    use the validator class while creating the `Control` objects.'
  prefs: []

- en: At first, the requirement of checking duplicate names against a data source
    (the mLab database) seems to be too a specific requirement and cannot be handled
    by a generic validator. But with some sensible assumptions and design choices,
    we can still implement a validator that can handle all types of remote validation,
    including workout name validation.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The plan is to create a validator that externalizes the actual validation logic.
    The directive will take the validation function as input. This implies that the
    actual validation logic is not a part of the validator but a part of the component
    that actually needs to validate input data. The job of the directive is just to
    call the function and return the appropriate error keys based on the function's
    return value.

    in terms of what it can access. Every single piece of code can manipulate any
    part of the rendered DOM. Hence, the encapsulation layer is broken. A badly written
