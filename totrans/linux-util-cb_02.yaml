- en: A computer desktop is normally composed of windows, icons, directories/folders,
    a toolbar, and some artwork. A window manager handles what the user sees and the
    tasks that are performed. A desktop is also sometimes referred to as a **graphical
    user interface** (**GUI**).

    Hat, Inc. It provides a very powerful and conventional desktop interface. There
    is a launcher menu for quicker access to applications, and also taskbars (called
    **panels**). Note that in most cases these can be located on the screen where
    the user desires.'

    and bottom "rows" are the panels. From the top, starting on the left, are the
    **Applications**, **Places**, and **System** menus. I then have a screensaver,
    the Firefox browser, a terminal, **Evolution**, and a Notepad. In the middle is
    the lock-screen app, and on the far right is a notification about updates, the
    volume control, Wi-Fi strength, battery level, the date/time, and the current
    user. Note that I have customized several of these, for example, the clock.

    extensively. It does have a few drawbacks, however. It tends to be somewhat "heavy"
    and may not perform well on less powerful machines. It also does not always report
    errors properly. For example, using Firefox open a local file that does not exist
    on your system (that is, `file:///tmp/LinuxBook.doc`). A **File Not Found** dialog
    should appear. Now try opening another local file that does exist, but which you
    do not have permissions for. It does not report an error, and in fact doesn't
    seem to do anything. Remember this if it happens to you.
