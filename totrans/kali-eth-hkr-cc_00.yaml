- en: Kali Linux is the distro, which comes to mind when anyone thinks about penetration
    testing. Every year Kali is improved and updated with new tools making it more
    powerful. We see new exploits being released every day and with rapidly evolving
    technology, we have rapidly evolving attack vectors. This book aims to cover the
    approach to some of the unique scenarios a user may face while performing a pentest.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book specifically focuses on using the Kali Linux to perform a pentest
    activity starting from information gathering till reporting. This book also covers
    recipes for testing wireless networks, web applications, and privilege escalations
    on both Windows and Linux machines and even exploiting vulnerabilities in software
    programs.
