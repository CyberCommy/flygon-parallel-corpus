    do our programs look like? These questions and more are at the heart of some of
    the differences between Python and Node.js, and it's important to understand when
    and where to use a particular language. For example, there are tasks for which
    a certain language is more suited than others, and it is the technologist's duty
    to advocate for the proper language. Let's investigate the use cases and different
    considerations when choosing Node.js versus Python.

    with. However, it's important to realize that not all programming languages are
    created for the same purpose. That is why it's very important to use the right
    tool for the job at hand. Just as you wouldn't attempt to build a house with a

- en: If you've been in the industry for a while, you have probably heard the term
    **stack**. In technology, a stack is the architectural combination of technologies
    used to create a program or multiple programs in an ecosystem. In the past, applications
    tended to be large-scale **monoliths**, built in a "one application to rule them
    all" mindset. In today's world, the use of monoliths is decreasing in favor of
    multiple, smaller applications and **microservices**. In this manner, different
    parts of a workflow can be distributed to completely independent processes, greatly
    increasing the stability of an overall system.

    asynchronous communication. The recommendation engine, however, can be a *completely
    separate stack* without any problems, since it's contained within an overall ecosystem

    It''s a very difficult problem to solve, so it''s best to consider another part
    of the timing aspect: technical debt. Tech debt is the bane of engineering teams,

    Do you remember Y2K? When it was discovered that many major applications in the

    year 1999 to 2000 would wreak havoc on computer systems. Thankfully, only minor
    glitches occurred, but the problem of tech debt arose: many of those systems were

  zh: 为什么这很重要，它与性能有什么关系？简而言之：*Python 无法对浏览器中的更改做出反应*。每次页面UI更改时执行Ajax请求是可能的，但这对浏览器和服务器在计算上都非常昂贵。此外，您必须使浏览器在每次更改时等待来自服务器的响应，导致非常卡顿的体验。因此，在浏览器中我们能做的越多，越好。在需要与服务器通信之前，使用浏览器中的JavaScript来处理逻辑是目标。

    from the previous section: *Node.js doesn''t run in the browser either!* That''s
    true! However, there''s the fact that Node.js is based on the Chrome interpreter
    and, as such, implicit in its design is the idea of asynchronicity. The event
    loop of Node.js is designed for, well, events—and inherent in the concept of events
    is that they''re asynchronous.'

- en: Let's decipher this. The single-thread event loop runs during the life cycle
    of a Node application and accepts inbound requests, either from a browser, another
    API, or other sources, and executes its work. If it's a simple request or specified
    as synchronous, it can be returned immediately. For more intensive operations,
    Node will register a *callback*. Remember that this is a term for a function that
    is passed to another function in order to be executed when the function it's passed
    to finishes its work. We've used these extensively as *event handlers* in JavaScript
    so far. The Node.js event loop provides an efficient means to access and serve
    data to our application.

- en: If you're not too familiar with the concepts of threads and processes, that's
    OK because we won't really dive in deep here. However, it's important to point
    out some facts about Node's use of processes and threads. It's stated by some
    computer scientists that the single-threaded nature of Node is inherently unscalable
    and that it can't stand up to the volume of traffic that a mature web app would
    need. However, as I mentioned previously, our applications don't live in a silo.
    No application that needs to be designed for scale is just going to hang out on
    a server alone. With the advent of cloud technologies such as Amazon AWS, it's
    easy to incorporate multiple virtual machines, load balancers, and other virtual
    tools to appropriately distribute the load for an application. Yes, Python may
    be better suited as a single-box application to receive thousands upon thousands
    of incoming requests, but this benchmark for performance is outdated and belies
    the state of technology today.

    for the task at hand. Node isn't a panacea for all the world's computing problems.
    In fact, it's specifically *not* designed to be a Swiss Army knife. It has its
    use and its place, but it doesn't try to be everything to everyone. The "do everything"
    nature of Java might be considered one of its weaknesses, in that while you can
    write Java code once and compile it for practically any architecture, there are
    limitations, considerations, and trade-offs that have been made to accommodate
    this. Node.js and JavaScript, in essence, try to stay in their own lanes.

    and understandable. Like any technology, there are always nuances, and one nuance
    of JavaScript and Node is this mantra that is in some Linux systems when you first
    log in as a superuser: "With great power comes great responsibility." While the
    provenance of the quote is nebulous, it''s important to think of when executing
    anything that has influence over others. (Don''t use hypnotism for evil!)'

    is that the browser would recognize an infinite loop and prompt a warning for
    you to exit the script because the page is unresponsive. A second outcome would
    be that the browser crashes, and in the worst-case scenario, the user's entire
    machine may crash with an out-of-memory exception. With great power...

    handling state and events. What if, for example, your frontend code was dependent
    upon a Node process and that process never returned? Luckily, there are Ajax safeguards
    built in to prevent this in most cases, in that HTTP requests will, by default,
    close after a certain period of time and error out if necessary. With that being
    said, there are a whole host of ways to force a connection to stay open, causing
    absolute chaos to a user''s browser. There are perfectly valid reasons for doing
    this, such as long polling for live data, so that''s why they exist. On the flip
    side, it''s also possible to accidentally cause major issues for a user. Fail
    safes such as timing out requests exist for  you protection, but any good engineer
    will tell you: don''t rely on fail safes—avoid errors in the design process.'

  zh: 同样，通过不正确地处理状态和事件，我们可以严重影响用户在Node中的体验。例如，如果您的前端代码依赖于一个Node进程，而该进程从未返回会怎么样？幸运的是，在大多数情况下，内置了Ajax保障措施，以防止这种情况发生，即HTTP请求将在一定时间后默认关闭并在必要时报错。话虽如此，有许多方法可以强制连接保持打开状态，从而对用户的浏览器造成绝对混乱。有很多正当的理由来做这件事，比如长轮询实时数据，这就是它们存在的原因。另一方面，也有可能意外地给用户造成重大问题。像超时请求这样的故障保护措施存在是为了保护您，但任何优秀的工程师都会告诉您：不要依赖故障保护措施——避免在设计过程中出现错误。
