- en: In this chapter, we walk through how to add audio and video to web pages using
    HTML5\. The advantage of embedding media using HTML5 in Dreamweaver is that it
    does not require any external player to work. For browsers that support the HTML5
    Audio or Video element, native media is the most elegant way to present audio
    and video online.

- en: Before launching our journey to embedding media with HTML5, let's step back
    for just a moment to survey the terrain. Until HTML5, if you wanted to listen
    to audio or watch video from a website, you had to do so through the agency of
    a browser plugin of one kind or another. That plugin might have been QuickTime
    Player (typically on a Mac), Windows Media Player (typically on a Windows computer),
    Flash, a plugin supplied by your hardware manufacturer, or some other program.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Since users listened to audio with the aid of plugins (such as Windows Media
    Player or QuickTime Player), web designers had almost no control over what appeared
    onscreen when a user listened to an audio. HTML5 provides what is called **native**
    audio (as well as native video). Native video does not require a plugin. The player
    and controls still vary some depending on the browsing environment, but with HTML5,
    the audio player is *relatively* standardized.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'There are two compatibility issues in presenting HTML5 audio and video: 1)
    a visitor''s browser must be HTML5 compliant; and 2) a visitor''s browser must
    support the particular audio format to which the audio or video is saved. So,
    in walking through the process of presenting HTML5 audio, we''ll explore how to
    handle both of these compatibility issues.'

    If you update Dreamweaver with Creative Cloud, more HTML5 elements (including
    audio and video) are available from the **Insert** menu (or **Insert** toolbar).
    But all versions of Dreamweaver CS6 (and 5.5) provide valuable code-hinting in
    **Code** (or **Split**) view, and that's the approach we will take here since
    it works in any Dreamweaver CS6 environment. And, besides, it is good to be exposed
    to and understand the `audio` and `video` tag syntax.

    as MP3, WAV, AIFF, and so on. Raw, uncompressed audio files, in the WAV (for Windows)
    and AIFF (for Macs) formats, provide the highest available online audio sound
    quality. But these files are very large, and download too slowly for most users.
    MP3 audio files, on the other hand, are substantially smaller in file size.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A compression algorithm is used to squeeze extra data out of files as they are
    converted to MP3\. And for most listeners, and most audio files, MP3 quality is
    sufficient. Thus, when we talk about making audio files available online, we are
    often talking about compressed audio files in formats such as MP3\. Another compressed
    file format is the OGG format.

    that you have a video of a person speaking against a background. It might well
    be the case that the background doesn't change throughout the video. Video compression
    software compacts the digital data necessary to present that video by organizing
    the data used to depict the background in such a way that it does not have to

    and video. We examined the evolving, different, and competing options for compressing
    audio and video supported by HTML5\. Moreover, we noted the need to provide a
    way to present our video for non-HTML5 browsing environments by creating a FLV
    file that will work in those pre-HTML5 browsing environments.

    tools are essentially code hints, which provide help in writing HTML5 `<video>`
    tags and their properties, and Live View which previews at least the Webkit (Safari)
    version of the video as we write code.
