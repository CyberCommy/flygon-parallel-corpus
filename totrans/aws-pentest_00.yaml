- en: Penetration testing has become a very effective method of validating and securing
    businesses, both small and large. The purpose of penetration testing is to evaluate
    the impact of vulnerabilities through the full enumeration and exploitation of
    objects, services, and processes within an organization. This book focuses on
    using an adapted version of penetration testing and applying it to ethically hacking
    and securing AWS's popular cloud services.

- en: '[*Chapter 1*](B15630_01_Final_ASB_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor025), *Building Your
    AWS Environment*, starts with the basics of AWS. AWS is a growing cloud technology
    provider that many companies are using to house their data. This chapter will
    help give you an understanding of how basic AWS environments are created, along
    with coverage of misconfigured services that can be exploited in a contained environment.
    No knowledge will be needed about AWS, and the chapter will give you everything
    you need to know about setting up your own AWS environment.'

    and Ethical Hacking*, gets into pentesting itself. Pentesting is beginning to
    grow in popularity; it''s becoming commonplace for companies to have pentests
    and find out what they don''t know about their systems. Pentesting is the practice
    of discovering and exploiting issues in IT systems that typical scanners don''t
    pick up. This chapter will give you a brief description of what pentesting is
    and give you hands-on practice with exercises using pentesting tools.'

    Pentesting and AWS*, talks tools. The first step in pentesting anything always
    involves scanning systems and resources. Pentesters use various tools and techniques
    to ensure that they properly scan systems and enumerate as much information as
    possible. This chapter will focus on using NMAP and Metasploit to grab information
    from targets that can be used in further exploitation.'

    S3 Buckets*, covers S3 buckets. S3 buckets are one of the primary resources that
    AWS uses to hold data. Also known as Simple Storage Service buckets, S3 buckets
    are great ways to hold objects such as data and metadata. However, much like other
    file storage solutions, S3 buckets can be easily exploited through simple misconfigurations.
    These misconfigurations can lead to data leaks and other serious security issues.
    The chapter will highlight S3 buckets, their functionality, and how to exploit
    issues with public buckets and misconfigured buckets.'

    Vulnerable RDS Services*, explores another AWS vulnerability. **Amazon Relational
    Database Service** (**RDS**) is scalable and makes it easy to set up cloud-based
    databases that allow users to operate just as they would with a typical database.
    RDS allows users to interact via services such as MySQL and Amazon Aurora just
    as a user would in a typical physical database infrastructure. The downfall of
    RDS is the same as that of regular databases: injection and misconfigurations.
    This chapter will go over common misconfigurations and how they can lead to possible
    injection.'

    and Pentesting AWS Aurora RDS*, continues our focus on databases. AWS Aurora provides
    SQL-like database functionality to AWS accounts with simplicity. Focused on PostgreSQL-
    and MySQL-like querying, Aurora makes interacting with high-performance storage
    systems easy for the user. Mistakes with it can have a deadly cost, however, and
    can lead to data leaks if it''s not adequately secured. This chapter is going
    to discuss the ins and outs of what Aurora has to offer and also take a look at
    the dangers of SQL injection – a malicious attack against websites that host services
    such as MySQL.'

    and Pentesting Lambda Services*, moves on to Lambda. Lambda allows users to create
    code that can later respond to events as needed. These events are anything that
    occurs within the AWS environment – HTTP requests, modifications to S3 buckets,
    or new EC2 instances being brought up, for instance. This chapter will focus on
    how vulnerability discovery in Lambda can lead to the exploitation of services
    and the discovery of internal processes and objects.'

    AWS API Gateway*, focuses on API Gateway. AWS API Gateway acts as the gateway
    to applications hosting data. The data being hosted by these applications varies;
    however, what does not is the fact that some of the data may be considered attractive
    to unauthorized personnel. This chapter will discuss what AWS API Gateway is,
    how to inspect API calls, and how to correct issues by pentesting API calls.'

    Pentesting with Metasploit and More!*, dives into Metasploit. Metasploit is an
    automated pentesting tool that enables pentesters to exploit with ease. Metasploit
    offers exploit payloads and has become a popular tool to use to test for common
    vulnerabilities. Metasploit also comes with the meterpreter shell, which allows
    pentesters to have reverse connections on the exploit systems. The reverse shell
    allows pentesters a certain level of control, based on rights, making pivoting
    and pilfering simple. This chapter will take a realistic look at how you would
    pentest AWS environments in a real-world setting using Metasploit.'

    Best Practices*, is where we recognize that pentesting is not a one-size-fits-all
    type of assessment. What applies to one pentest may not apply to another. It''s
    essential to stay on top of trends, hone your skillset, and develop your understanding
    of what it means to pentest. This chapter will discuss best practices when it
    comes to maintaining pentesting skills and updating processes, as well as discussing
    how to keep up with pentesting.'

    of Trouble*, looks at the potential impacts of what you''ll be doing. Pentesting
    can be very intrusive on AWS systems and can also lead to legal issues if not
    executed correctly. When pentesting AWS, it''s crucial to understand what you
    as a pentester can and cannot do on an AWS system. This chapter will go over the
    dos and don''ts of pentesting AWS, as well as talking about denial of service,
    flooding, and the legal impact that those techniques can have on a pentest team.'

    growing in popularity at a large scale. This growth has caused many security services
    to create training platforms for companies to test and train in "safe spaces"
    for AWS pentesting. This chapter will look at various projects that can be integrated
    to augment your AWS pentesting methods.'
