    If you practice the art of effective searching and take note of a few useful starting
    places for your search, you're going to accelerate your learning enormously. Software
    development changes extremely quickly, and cutting-edge software development such
    as real-time VR changes even more so. The time you spend learning how to search
    for information effectively will serve you forever.

    about Unreal Engine is at the source. [https://www.unrealengine.com](https://www.unrealengine.com) should
    be one of the first places you look any time you need new information. You can
    get there via a browser or find the information in your Epic Games launcher.

    clearly demonstrates you haven''t done your homework, so you''ll be ignored. Good

    within the engine or out in the professional world. They generally take the form
    of a series of video lessons, and the quality is consistently high. This is one

    is another resource many new developers overlook, but you shouldn''t; it''s important.
    Here''s the thing: Unreal Engine is absolutely huge, and with hundreds of engineers
    working on it, along with thousands more in the community, it evolves and grows
    fast. Because of this, there''s a ton of amazingly useful stuff in the Engine
    that just hasn''t been documented anywhere because it''s too new or too niche.
    The secret to finding this stuff are the *Live Training* videos on the Unreal
    Engine channel. These are nearly always given by whatever engineer wrote the system
    they''re talking about or by a trainer who knows it really well, and they''re
    a fountain of useful information. If you really want to learn how to use this
    engine, this is the place to do it.'

    events, and then go to them. This is one of the biggest secrets we see new developers

    for collaborators, looking to get hired, or looking to hire someone, you''re doing
    yourself a big service by getting out there and participating in the community.'

    is **Stack Overflow** ([https://stackoverflow.com/](https://stackoverflow.com/)).
    It's not Unreal-centric, but if you're looking for information on C++ development,
    this is where you'll find some of the most experienced developers on the web.
    Be warned though—the Stack community is notoriously intolerant of low-effort questions.
    Be respectful of everyone's time and come in with a question after you've gone
    as far as you can to find the answer to it on your own. Describe what you were
    trying to do, what you did, and what challenges you faced. Do this, and you'll
    get some of the most reliable expert advice you can get on the web.

    out, and nearly anything you read will wind up being some combination of legitimate
    information and unfounded opinion and lore. That's nobody's fault—this medium
    is simply too new for us to understand fully.

    and we want to repeat that here. Remember that the earliest surviving motion picture
    was made in 1888, and it wasn't until 1925 that Sergei Eisenstein really figured
    out the language of film editing. It took thirty-seven years to figure out one
    of the most fundamental aspects of the genre. *Citizen Kane* came sixteen years
    after that. Please remember this when somebody tells you what you can't do in
    VR. We haven't got the faintest inkling of a clue what the limits of this medium
    are. Dive in and play with it. You're working on a frontier. Don't be afraid to
    try weird things you think might not work. This is how discoveries are made.

    VR *dead* because it hasn''t yet erupted into a mass medium in the space of two
    years: that''s not how new means of communication propagate through society. It
    took almost three decades for cellular phones to become common consumer devices
    and longer for personal computers. This is no different. At the time of this writing,
    we''re still on the first generation of consumer VR headsets, with heavy lenses
    and wires, narrow fields of view, and external sensors. (On the morning this paragraph
    was written, Oculus announced its first desktop headset with inside-out tracking.)
    We''re very, very early in the development of this hardware, with a lot of technical
    challenges still to overcome, but it''s evident to anyone really paying attention
    that they are going to be overcome. We have no way of knowing whether, when you
    read this, we''ll be in another *VR is dead* phase or another VR gold rush, or
    hopefully somewhere in the middle, but think about this from a standpoint of reality.
    When XR headsets are as comfortable to wear as glasses, don''t require wires,
    have batteries that can last all day, and can offer immersive fields of view,
    we''ll all be using them. This medium isn''t going away. Work in it because you
    love it.'

    century about the ways media and communication shape our society. You''ve been
    swimming through an ocean of his ideas whether you''ve heard his name before or
    not. *The medium is the message*—that''s him. *Global village*—also McCluhan.
    His central work, *Understanding Media*, is a sometimes-challenging read, but
    it quite literally changed how we viewed the role of electronic media in the world.
    We bring him up here because to work in VR is to work on a frontier of communication
    technology that, through its powers of immersion and presence, has the potential
    to shape us more dramatically than anything previously has. McCluhan would have
    been fascinated by VR and probably terrified of what it could do to us. Why not
    put some thought into what that might mean?'

    to write an exhaustive list of resources on a topic as new and fluid as VR, and
    it's possibly futile given that this is a medium within which five-month-old information
    is considered woefully out-of-date. Consider these resources as starting points,
    but understand that they're far from complete. Let your own exploration take you
    where it will.
