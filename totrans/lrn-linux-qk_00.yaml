- en: If you have always wanted to learn Linux but are still afraid to do so, this
    book is for you! A lot of people think of Linux as a sophisticated operating system
    that only hackers and geeks know how to use, and thus they abort their dream of
    learning Linux. Well, let me surprise you! Linux is simple and easy to learn,
    and this book is the ultimate proof! You may have stumbled across a variety of
    sources that all explain Linux in a complicated and dry manner. This book does
    exactly the opposite; it teaches you Linux in a delightful and friendly way so
    that you will never get bored, and you will always feel motivated to learn more.
    *Learn Linux Quickly* doesn't assume any prior Linux knowledge, which makes it
    a perfect fit for beginners. Nevertheless, intermediate and advanced Linux users
    will still find this book very useful as it goes through a wide range of topics.

    Linux as your main OS on your computer; this way you get to work with Linux on
    a daily basis. If that's not an option for you, then why not get a cheap Raspberry
    Pi and start playing around with it?
