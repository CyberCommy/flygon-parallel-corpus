- en: So far, we have learned about the basic building blocks of functional programming.
    It's time to take them for a spin and visit the world of software design focused
    on functions.

- en: First, we will look at a way of changing our mindset from **object-oriented
    programming** (**OOP**) written in an imperative manner to function-centric design.
    To do so, we need to understand how to transform input data into the desired output
    data, preferably with the help of existing higher-order functions. Then, we will
    look at the **Don't Repeat Yourself** (**DRY**) principle and how we can use functional
    operations (partial application, currying, and functional composition) to remove
    certain types of duplication from our code. We will then look at the relationship
    between functions and classes, how we can group pure functions into classes if
    we want to switch a design from function-focused to OOP, and how we can turn a
    class into a set of pure functions.

    and how it is simplified through the use of pure functions.
