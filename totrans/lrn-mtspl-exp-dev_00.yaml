- en: This book has been designed in well-defined stages to facilitate effective learning.
    From the actual setup to vulnerability assessment, and finally exploitation, this
    book gives in-depth knowledge of penetration testing. The book deals with vulnerability
    assessment exercises with some of the industrially-used tools and report making
    tips. It covers the topics of client exploitation, backdoors, post-exploitation,
    and also exploit development with Metasploit.
