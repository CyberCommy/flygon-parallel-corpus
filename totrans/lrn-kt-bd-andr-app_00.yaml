    across the globe provides a real opportunity to make a difference. A phone, which
    was just a device for voice communication until recently, is **not** **ju****st**
    a phone anymore. Enabling and empowering the next billion users of Android devices
    will play a significant role in the future.

    devices provides the opportunity for innovations and can improve the lives of
    people through technology. Whether it is an app that is built for farmers that
    provides useful information about the weather or prices of crops, or an app that
    is built for children with special needs to express themselves, or an app that
    is built for economically challenged women to run a small home-based business,
    the opportunities ahead are plenty and very exciting.

    Google has added Kotlin as one of the official languages for Android application
    development. Kotlin is expressive, concise, and powerful. It also ensures seamless
    interoperability with existing Android languages such as Java and the runtime.
