    an art, but writing understandable code is surely more like philosophy. In that
    chapter, we discussed practices that you, as a software architect, need to observe
    for your developers. In this chapter, we will describe the techniques and tools
    for code analysis, so that you have well-written code for your projects.

- en: It is not easy to define whether code is well-written. The best practices described
    in *Chapter 17*, *Best Practices in Coding C# 9*, can certainly guide you as a
    software architect to define a standard for your team. But even with a standard,
    mistakes will happen, and you will probably find them only after the code is in
    production. The decision to refactor code in production just because it does not
    follow all the standards you define is not an easy one to take, especially if
    the code in question is working properly. Some people conclude that well-written
    code is simply code that works well in production. However, this can surely cause
    damage to the software's life since developers can be inspired by that non-standard
    code.

    adherence to the coding standard you've defined. Luckily, nowadays, we have many
    options for tools that can help us with this task. They are regarded as the automation
    of static code analysis. This technique is seen as a great opportunity to improve
    the software developed and to help developers.

    to disseminate knowledge between them during code inspections. The tools that
    we have now have the same purpose. Better than that, with Roslyn, they do this
    task while you are writing the code. Roslyn is the compiler platform for .NET,
    and it enables you to develop some tools for analyzing code. These analyzers can
    check style, quality, design, and other issues.
