    fashion. Data is saved in tables. A table consists of columns with different datatypes.
    Every row in a table corresponds to a data record. You may think of a table as
    an Excel spreadsheet. From the perspective of object-oriented programming, every
    table in a database usually describes an object (represented by a class). Each
    table column illustrates a class attribute. Every record in a table represents

- en: The next two methods, `getReadableDatabase()` and `getWriteableDatabase()`,
    are the methods in which the database is actually created or opened. Both return
    the same `SQLiteDatabase` object; the difference lies in the fact that `getReadableDatabase()`
    will return a readable database in case it cannot return a writable database,
    whereas `getWriteableDatabase()` returns a writable database object. The `getWriteableDatabase()`
    method will throw an `SQLiteException` if a database cannot be opened for writing.
    In case of `getReadableDatabase()`, if a database cannot be opened, it will throw
    the same exception.

- en: We can use the `isReadOnly()` method of the `SQLiteDatabase` class on the database
    object to know the state of the database. It returns `true` for read-only databases.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Calling either methods will invoke the `onCreate()` method if the database doesn't
    exist yet. Otherwise, it will invoke the `onOpen()` or `onUpgrade()` methods,
    depending on the version number. The `onOpen()` method should check the `isReadOnly()`
    method before updating the database. Once opened, the database is cached to improve
    performance. Finally, we need to call the `close()` method to close the database
    object.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The `onCreate()`, `onOpen()`, and `onUpgrade()` methods are designed for the
    subclass to implement the intended behavior. The `onCreate()` method is called
    when the database is created for the first time. This is the place where we create
    our tables by using SQLite statements, which we saw earlier in the example. The
    `onOpen()` method is triggered when the database has been configured and after
    the database schema has been created, upgraded, or downgraded as necessary. Read/write
    status should be checked here with the help of the `isReadOnly()` method.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The `onUpgrade()` method is called when the database needs to be upgraded depending
    on the version number supplied to it. By default, the database version is `1`,
    and as we increment the database version numbers and release new versions, the
    upgrade will be performed.

- en: Now that you are familiar with the helper class that kick-starts the use of
    SQLite databases within Android, it's time to look at the core `SQLiteDatabase`
    class. `SQLiteDatabase` is the base class required to work with an SQLite database
    in Android and provides methods to open, query, update, and close the database.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: More than 50 methods are available for the `SQLiteDatabase` class, each with
    its own nuances and use cases. Rather than an exhaustive list, we'll cover the
    most important subsets of methods and allow you to explore some of the overloaded
    methods at your leisure. At any time, you can refer to the full online Android
    documentation for the `SQLiteDatabase` class at [http://developer.android.com/reference/android/database/sqlite/SQLiteDatabase.html](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/database/sqlite/SQLiteDatabase.html).

    being inserted for that column is `1`.'

- en: A query recovers a `Cursor` object. A `Cursor` object depicts the result of
    a query and fundamentally points to one row of the result of the query. With this
    method, Android can buffer the results of the query in a productive manner; as
    it doesn't need to load all of the data into memory.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To obtain the elements of the resulting query, you can use the `getCount()`
    method.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To navigate amid individual data rows, you can utilize the `moveToFirst()` and
    `moveToNext()` methods. The `isAfterLast()` method permits you to analyze whether
    the end of the output has arrived.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The `Cursor` object provides typed `get*()` methods, for example, the `getLong(columnIndex)`
    and `getString(columnIndex)` methods to gain entry to the column data for the
    ongoing position of the result. `columnIndex` is the number of the column you
    will be accessing.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The `Cursor` object also provides the `getColumnIndexOrThrow(String)` method
    that permits you to get the column index for a column name of the table.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To close the `Cursor` object, the `close()` method call will be used.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A database query returns a cursor. This interface provides random read-write
    access to the result set. It points to a row of the query result that enables
    Android to buffer the results effectively since now it is not required to load
    all the data in the memory.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The pointer of the returned cursor points to the 0th location, which is known
    as the first location of the cursor. We need to call the `moveToFirst()` method
    on the `Cursor` object; it takes the cursor pointer to the first location. Now
    we can access the data present in the first record.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Cursor implementations, if from multiple threads, should perform their own synchronization
    when using the cursor. A cursor needs to be closed to free the resource the object
    holds by calling the `close()` method.
