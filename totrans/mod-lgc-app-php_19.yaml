- en: This script was part of a system allowed journalism students to write articles
    for review, and to provide feedback on articles from fellow students. The students
    would offer "credits" for other students to review their work, and would receive
    credits from others by reviewing their articles. Because credits were paid per
    review, the students would limit the maximum number of reviews to make sure they
    did not run out of credits. Finally, they were allowed to provide notes indicating
    what the reviewer should pay attention to.

    classes. It contains only the domain logic and data source interactions, not the
    preliminary setup or any display code.
