- en: This book is a guide to getting started with Kubernetes and overall container
    management. We will walk you through the features and functions of Kubernetes
    and show how it fits into an overall operations strategy. You'll learn what hurdles
    lurk in moving container off the developer's laptop and managing them at a larger
    scale. You'll also see how Kubernetes is the perfect tool to help you face these
    challenges with confidence.
