- en: Web technologies are changing rapidly and so is the ArcGIS JavaScript API. Regardless
    of your development experience, ArcGIS offers an easy way to create and manage
    geospatial applications. It gives you access to mapping and visualization, analysis,
    3D, data management, and support for real time data.

- en: '[Chapter 1](ch01.html "Chapter 1. Foundation for the API"), *Foundation for
    the API*, endeavors to lay a firm foundation for the topics dealt with throughout
    the book. The basic environment needed to follow the explained topics further
    as well as to develop professional-looking code is set in this chapter. An introduction
    to dojo and the modular pattern of JavaScript coding is provided along with an
    explanation of basic ArcGIS concepts. Users are shown brief explanations with
    code snippets or diagrams about basic concepts wherever needed.'

- en: '[Chapter 2](ch02.html "Chapter 2. Layers and Widgets"), *Layers and Widgets*,
    deals with the different types of layers used in the API along with the ideal
    context where each type is used. We will also be introduced to some of the most
    commonly used in-built widgets provided by Esri to use in our application.'

- en: '[Chapter 3](ch03.html "Chapter 3. Writing Queries"), *Writing Queries*, will
    have an in-depth look into writing different types of queries, retrieving the
    results and displaying it. We will be developing a Wildfire app to understand
    how the types of query operations such as Identify, Find and Query task. We will
    also learn how to display a tabular information using a FeatureTable widget and
    format popup content using Infotemplates.'

- en: '[Chapter 4](ch04.html "Chapter 4. Building Custom Widgets"), *Building Custom
    Widgets*, will explain how to organize all the code into modularized widgets,
    and use it in our application. We will discuss how to configure dojo globally
    and how to provide support for internationalization. We will be extending the
    Wildfire app we developed in the previous chapter by constructing a spatial query
    that involves using the Draw toolbar.'

- en: '[Chapter 5](ch05.html "Chapter 5. Working with Renderers"), *Working with Renderers*,
    gives an in-depth treatment on the topic of colors, symbols, renderers, and the
    situations where each can be used effectively. This chapter will also deal with
    the nuances of data visualization techniques along with tips and tricks to create
    symbols and picture marker symbols easily. We will demonstrate the utility of
    three basic renderers: simple renderer, unique value renderer, and class breaks
    renderer by developing a Stream Gauge app.'

    Real-Time Data*, will cover in detail what constitutes the real-time data, and
    it will also cover how to visualize data and get the most recently updated data.
    We will be building a hurricane tracking app to demonstrate this and will be adding
    a Global wind data gauge and a weather widget using geometry engine capability
    provided by the API and the geolocation feature provided by modern browsers.'

    *Map Analytics and Visualization Techniques*, will take you a step closer toward
    becoming a map data scientist. We will cover a lot of ground in this chapter starting
    with a brush up of a few introductory statistics concepts. We will see the code
    in action and understand how statistics definition and feature layer statistics
    module can give us invaluable statistic measures, which can be used to render
    the map data meaningfully. We will then evaluate how to use the visual variables,
    such as colorInfo, opacityInfo, rotationInfo, and sizeInfo effectively in a renderer.
    We will use the knowledge gained to start building a demographics analytic portal.'

    *Advanced Map Visualization and Charting Libraries*, will be using three different
    charting libraries such as dojo, D3.js and Cedar to extend the Demographics portal
    we started building in the previous chapter and more provide visual-analytical
    information to the users.'

    with Time Aware Layers*, will explain how to visualize spatiotemporal data using
    TimeSlider dijit, a custom D3.js timeslider as well a custom Time series Histogram
    by incorporating these on a Time-aware US Drought data.'
