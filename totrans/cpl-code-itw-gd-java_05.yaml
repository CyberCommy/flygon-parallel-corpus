    main purpose of this chapter is to show you how to identify the causes of failure
    and how to mitigate them in the future.

- en: However, before discussing handling failures, let’s quickly tackle the proper
    way to accept or decline an offer. At the end of an interview, or at some point
    during the interview, you may find yourself in a position to accept or decline
    an offer. This is not about giving a simple and dry yes or no answer.

- en: Accepting an offer is quite simple. You need to inform the company that you
    accept the offer and discuss details such as the starting date (especially if
    you need to work a notice period at your current workplace), paperwork, reallocation
    (if it is the case), and so on.

- en: Declining an offer is a bit more of a delicate situation. It must be done in
    a way that allows you to remain in good relations with everyone. The company has
    invested time and resources in the interview, and so you have to decline their
    offer politely. You may also, after a while, consider applying to the company
    again. For example, you can say something like *I want to thank you for the offer.
    I was impressed with your company and I enjoyed the interview process, but I’ve
    decided it’s not the right choice for me right now. Thank you again, and maybe
    someday we will meet again.*

- en: There are some cases when you need to manage multiple offers. While you accept
    an offer, you have to decline another. In the IT industry, it is very important
    to build contacts and maintain them over time. People frequently change their
    jobs and positions, and in this dynamic environment, it is important to not squander
    any contacts. Therefore, don’t forget to call the hiring managers (or the contact
    person) that made you an offer and inform them about your decision. You can use
    the same phrase given previously. If you cannot call, then send an email or go
    to the office to meet them in person.

    are just movies! An interview always ends with an offer or a rejection, and so
    failure is an option. It is our task to mitigate failures.

    Each of us reacts to failure in a different and human way. From feeling disappointed
    and resigned to having a nervous reaction or saying things that you’ll later be
    sorry about, these all are normal human reactions. However, it is important that
    you control these reactions and act professionally. This means applying a set
    of steps that will mitigate failures in the near future. To begin with, it is
    important to understand why you have been rejected.

    it correct to say or think that company X rejected you? I would say that this
    formulation is toxic and sounds like the company has something personal against
    you. This formulation of thoughts should be cut off right from the start. Instead,
    you should try to find out what went wrong.'

    in skills and/or expectations? Most probably, this is much closer to reality.
    There are two parties in an interview (you and the interviewer), and both parties
    try to identify the matches or compatibilities that allow them to collaborate
    with a subjective approach. Once you think like this, you will not blame yourself
    and you’ll try to find out what went wrong.

    the mismatches, you have to be aware that it can be pretty subjective. It is important
    to read the feedback carefully, and as you recall the phases of the interview,
    overlap their feedback with your memory of it with an objective approach.

    attempts, they don’t stop. Is continuing to try perseverance or obsession? Has
    their dream job become an obsession or they should continue to try? These are
    extremely personal questions, but, as a rule of thumb, obsessions are always toxic
    and they don’t lead to anything good. If you find yourself in this situation,
    or you know somebody that is, then it is time to change your attitude and think
    that maybe the following is the proper way to think.

  zh: 有些人很难被某家公司录用。即使经过两三次尝试，他们也不会停止。继续尝试是毅力还是固执？他们的梦想工作已经变成了固执，还是他们应该继续尝试？这些都是非常个人的问题，但作为一个经验法则，固执总是有害的，不会带来任何好处。如果你发现自己处于这种情况，或者你认识有人处于这种情况，那么现在是时候改变你的态度，认为也许以下是正确的思考方式。

    better. However, that’s not true! It happens all the time and in many contexts.
    For example, a singer at the beginning of her career went on a famous singing
    show and didn’t win any prizes; she didn’t even place among the ones who were
    considered to be good. She didn’t try out for the contest again (as in the section
    title), but a few years later, she won her first Grammy award.

  zh: 这个标题听起来像是一句鼓励的空洞口号，旨在让你感觉更好。然而，这并不是真的！这种情况经常发生，在许多情境中都有。例如，一位刚开始职业生涯的歌手参加了一档著名的歌唱比赛，并没有赢得任何奖项；她甚至没有被认为是优秀的人之一。她没有再次参加比赛（就像章节标题中的情况），但几年后，她赢得了她的第一个格莱美奖。
- en: There are tons of examples like this in real life. The singer didn’t lose her
    confidence in her skills and she were right! That famous singing show didn’t deserve
    her. After years, the show organizer invited the singer to sing again (this time
    as a guest) and the organizer apologized for what had happened.
