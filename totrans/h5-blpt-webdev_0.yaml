- en: This book is for all the authors who are familiar with creating web projects
    using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. No in-depth knowledge is necessary. Some knowledge
    of what a web server is and how it can be configured is good to have. Also, you
    should not be afraid to use the command-line tool (fear not! There are links within
    the book that should make you less afraid). There are no expectations that you
    should know about HTML5 Boilerplate, except that you only try it once to see if
    it works for you.
