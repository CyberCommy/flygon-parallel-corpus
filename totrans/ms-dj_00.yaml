    programming: control structures (such as if, while, or for), data structures (lists,
    hashes/dictionaries), variables, classes, and objects. Experience in web development
    is, as you may expect, very helpful, but it is not required to understand this
    book. Throughout the book, I try to promote best practices in web development
    for readers who lack this experience.'

- en: At its core, Django is simply a collection of libraries written in the Python
    programming language. To develop a site using Django, you write Python code that
    uses these libraries. Learning Django, then, is a matter of learning how to program
    in Python and understanding how the Django libraries work. If you have experience
    programming in Python, you should have no trouble diving in. By and large, the
    Django code doesn't perform a lot of *magic* (that is, programming trickery whose
    implementation is difficult to explain or understand). For you, learning Django
    will be a matter of learning Django's conventions and APIs.

    easy to learn and a joy to use! Although this book doesn't include a full Python
    tutorial, it highlights Python features and functionality where appropriate, particularly
    when code doesn't immediately make sense. Still, I recommend you read the official
    Python tutorial (for more information visit [http://docs.python.org/tut/](http://docs.python.org/tut/)).
    I also recommend Mark Pilgrim's free book *Dive Into Python*, available online
    at [http://www.diveintopython.net/](http://www.diveintopython.net/) and published
    in print by Apress.

    developers maintain backwards compatibility as much as possible, some backwards
    incompatible changes do get introduced occasionally. The changes in each release
    are always covered in the release notes, which you can find at [https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/releases/](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/releases/).

- en: This book assumes you have a basic understanding of the Internet and programming.
    Experience with Python or Django would be an advantage, but is not necessary.
    It is ideal for beginner to intermediate programmers looking for a fast, secure,
    scalable, and maintainable alternative web development platform to those based
    on PHP, Java, and dotNET.
