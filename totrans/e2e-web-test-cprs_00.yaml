- en: Cypress is a JavaScript automation testing framework created with the sole purpose
    of performing frontend testing. Cypress excels at re-inventing how testing is
    carried out, especially for the modern web. Unlike other testing frameworks, such
    as Selenium WebDriver, Cypress is much faster as it runs in the browser and also
    has a lower learning curve compared to other testing frameworks.

    to use with this practical guide and develop their skills in end-to-end testing.
    This book takes a hands-on approach to implementation and associated methodologies
    that will have you up and running and productive in no time.

- en: The book is for testing professionals, software and web testers, and web developers
    who are well-versed in JavaScript and might or might not be familiar with the
    concepts of automation testing. The first three chapters offer a quick introductory
    guide that will help you familiarize yourself with how Cypress works and how to
    get started if you are a complete Cypress newbie. If you are a Selenium tester
    who wants to migrate to Cypress and uncover its capabilities, you’ll find this
    book very useful. A good understanding of web testing and JavaScript is required.

- en: '[*Chapter 1*](B15616_01_Final_NM_ePUB.xhtml#_idTextAnchor025), *Installing
    and Setting Up Cypress*, takes you through the essentials of getting started with
    Cypress, including the installation of the Cypress package, the default configurations,
    and the customization of settings. In this chapter, you will learn about how Cypress
    works, what modules it requires to run, the test file naming recommendations,
    and how to get started with using Cypress. Understanding how Cypress works will
    ensure that you are able to grasp the internal workings of Cypress and will be
    able to install and set up the subsequent projects on your own with a full understanding
    of the Cypress framework''s structure.'

    between Selenium WebDriver and Cypress,* is where we will explore how Cypress
    is different from the Selenium WebDriver and highlight some of the pros and the
    cons of choosing Cypress to run end-to-end tests. In this chapter, we will also
    explore elements that make Cypress more suitable to testing than Selenium and
    how users can extend its functionality.'

    you can use to execute Cypress commands. The chapter will explain how to run the
    commands and also how to debug the application using Cypress commands.'

    First Test*, will see you write your first test using Cypress. We will start with
    a passing test to check that everything works correctly, then move on to a failing
    test, and then we''ll see how Cypress behaves and how the auto-reload feature
    works. In the second section of this chapter, we will focus on more advanced scenarios
    of getting you up to speed with how to properly write Cypress tests.'

    Tests*, dives into the different kinds of tools that Cypress includes to aid in
    debugging applications. Using Cypress'' debugging tools, you will learn how to
    travel back to the snapshot of each command, see different page events that happened
    during execution, and visualize different commands and the times when elements
    were hidden and found. You will also learn how you can step forward and backward between
    command snapshots and pause and step through command snapshots in an iterative
    manner.'

    to write tests using a TDD approach and also dive deep into how you can practically
    apply TDD in an application that is yet to be developed.'

    to hover over elements, and how to check whether elements are disabled. By the
    end of this chapter, you will be comfortable with navigating through the DOM elements
    and writing meaningful tests for elements.'

    our tests by using aliases. Finally, we will identify how to use aliases with

    complicated to receive responses from. Cypress stubbing will be important to ensuring
    that implemented tests are not flaky and that we can have custom responses instead
    of waiting for server responses from a request.'

    is to the modern web. We will also look at viewports and how they influence the
    process of visual testing and finally look at visual testing automated tools such
    as Applitools and Percy that we can use to carry out visual validation.'

    the Yarn and npm package managers installed on your machine. All the code examples
    given have been tested on macOS and should work okay with all Linux OSes too.
    For Windows OSes, especially for the last three chapters, kindly read the additional
    notes in the callout box, in the *Technical requirements* section on how to run
    the commands on Windows. At the time of writing, all the examples have been tested
    with Cypress version 6.2.1.
