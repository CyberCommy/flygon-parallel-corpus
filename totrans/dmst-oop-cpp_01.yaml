- en: The goal of this section is to ensure that you have a strong background in non-OO
    C++ skills in which to build the forthcoming OOP skills in C++. This is the shortest
    section of the book, designed to quickly get you up to speed in preparation for
    the OOP and more advanced book chapters.

    in the book: basic language syntax, looping constructs, operators, function usage,
    user defined type basics (struct, typedef and class basics, enum), and namespace
    basics. The next chapter discusses const qualified variables, function prototyping,
    prototyping with default values, and function overloading.'

- en: The subsequent chapter covers indirect addressing with pointers by introducing
    new() and delete() to allocate basic types of data, dynamically allocating arrays
    of 1, 2, and N dimensions, managing memory with delete, passing parameters as
    arguments to functions, and using void pointers. This section concludes with a
    chapter featuring indirect addressing with references that will take you through
    a review of reference basics, references to existing objects, and as arguments
    to functions.
