- en: In 2004, the WHAT Working Group was formed with members from Mozilla, Apple,
    and Opera. The more commonly used name **WHATWG** stands for Web Hypertext Application
    Technology Working Group. The groups main goal was to enable the evolution and
    development of HTML. Slow development of HTML by **W3C** was also a reason for
    the group formation.

- en: The focus of the group is the HTML standard, which also includes web storage,
    web sockets, web workers, and server-side events. There were other standards as
    well that were developed and discussed in the past. The editor of the specification
    is Ian "Hixie" Hickson ([http://www.hixie.ch/](http://www.hixie.ch/)).

- en: We often referred to the WHATWG specification throughout the book, and it is
    the most up-to-date document, because it is a living standard. This means that
    the standard is continuously updated as requests for change arrive from the community.
    On the other hand, the specification does not simply break in backwards-incompatible
    ways.

    including non-profit organizations, companies, as well as individuals. You must
    be a member to access this site. Anyone can become a member as long as his/her
    application is approved by W3C. Additionally, each member pays fee adjusted for

    composed of companies, who can afford to pay and spend considerable amount of
    money on meetings and travel.

    XHTML standard that never fully took-off. Currently, the two groups have different
    goals. WHATWG is more focused in what browsers should aim for, on the other hand,
    W3C has specific snapshots of the living standard making them diverge. Hixie,
    the editor of WHATWG, sends the feedback to both the groups. For more information
    on how the two specifications differ see the following URL:'
