- en: This section forms the backbone of this book and will introduce you to more
    advanced topics that relate to Cypress and how to use it. In this section, there
    will be an introduction to how we can think through an idea and use **Test-Driven
    Development** (**TDD**) to take our idea from the conception stage through to
    development. In this chapter, we will also learn about topics such as interacting
    with elements using Cypress, the use of aliases, and the Cypress Test Runner.
