- en: The world is becoming interconnected on an unprecedented scale with more services
    being provided on the Internet. Applications ranging from business transactions
    to embedded applications, such as those found in refrigerators, are connecting
    to the Internet. With isolated applications no longer being the norm, it is becoming
    increasingly important for applications to be network enabled.

- en: The goal of this book is to provide the reader with the necessary skills to
    develop Java applications that connect and work with other applications and services
    across a network. You will be introduced to a wide range of networking options
    that are available using Java, which will enable you to develop applications using
    the appropriate technology for the task at hand.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 1](ch01.html "Chapter 1. Getting Started with Network Programming"),
    *Getting Started with Network Programming*, introduces the essential network terminology
    and concepts. The networking support that Java provides is illustrated with brief
    examples. A simple client/server application is presented along with a threaded
    version of the server.'

- en: '[Chapter 2](ch02.html "Chapter 2. Network Addressing"), *Network Addressing*,
    explains how nodes on a network use addresses. How Java represents these addresses
    is introduced along with support for IPv4 and IPv6\. This chapter also covers
    how Java can configure various network properties.'

- en: '[Chapter 3](ch03.html "Chapter 3. NIO Support for Networking"), *NIO Support
    for Networking*, explains how the NIO package provides support for communication
    using buffers and channels. These techniques are illustrated with a client/server
    application. The support that NIO provides for asynchronous communication is also
    demonstrated.'

- en: '[Chapter 4](ch04.html "Chapter 4. Client/Server Development"), *Client/Server
    Development*, covers how HTTP is an important and widely-used protocol. Java provides
    support for this protocol in a variety of ways. These techniques are illustrated
    along with a demonstration of how cookies are handled in Java.'

- en: '[Chapter 5](ch05.html "Chapter 5. Peer-to-Peer Networks"), *Peer-to-Peer Networks*,
    discusses how peer-to-peer networks provide a flexible alternative to the traditional
    client/server architecture. The basic peer-to-peer concepts are introduced along
    with demonstrations of how Java supports this architecture. FreePastry is used
    to illustrate one open source peer-to-peer solution framework.'

- en: '[Chapter 6](ch06.html "Chapter 6. UDP and Multicasting"), *UDP and Multicasting*,
    explains how UDP is an alternative to TCP. It provides a less reliable but more
    efficient way for applications to communicate across the Internet. Java''s extensive
    support for this protocol is demonstrated, including NIO support, and how UDP
    can support streaming media.'

- en: '[Chapter 7](ch07.html "Chapter 7. Network Scalability"), *Network Scalability*,
    explains how, as more demands are placed on a server, systems need to scale to
    address these demands. Several threading techniques supporting this need are demonstrated,
    including thread pools, futures, and the NIO''s selector.'

- en: '[Chapter 8](ch08.html "Chapter 8. Network Security"), *Network Security*, discusses
    how applications need to protect against a variety of threats. This is supported
    in Java using encryption and secure hashing techniques. Symmetric and asymmetric
    encryption techniques are illustrated. In addition, the use of TLS/SSL is demonstrated.'

- en: '[Chapter 9](ch09.html "Chapter 9. Network Interoperability"), *Network Interoperability*,
    covers how Java applications may need to exchange information with other applications
    that are written in different languages. The issues that impact an application''s
    interoperability are examined, including byte order. Communication between different
    implementations is demonstrated using sockets and middleware.'
