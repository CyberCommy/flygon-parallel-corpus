- en: This book is designed to teach readers how to run Nmap, one of the most powerful
    network security tools ever created. I'm excited to walk you through learning
    this tool, as well as the various different elements that come with it—for example,
    the Nmap Scripting Engine and other tools like Ncat and Ncrack. Throughout this
    book, we'll be walking through techniques, tips, and tricks to help you learn
    the essentials of Nmap in a fast and efficient manner!

    running either Windows, Linux, or Mac OS X. We'll be installing Nmap and VirtualBox
    as part of running through this book; these are two free pieces of software that
    can help us run network scans. Additionally, an Internet or local network connection
    is valuable for trying out scans.
