- en: GNU/Linux is a remarkable operating system that comes with a complete development
    environment that is stable, reliable, and extremely powerful. The shell, being
    the native interface to communicate with the operating system, is capable of controlling
    the entire operating system. An understanding of shell scripting helps you to
    have better awareness of the operating system and helps you to automate most of
    the manual tasks with a few lines of script, saving you an enormous amount of
    time. Shell scripts can work with many external command-line utilities for tasks
    such as querying information, easy text manipulation, scheduling task running
    times, preparing reports, sending mails, and so on. There are numerous commands
    on the GNU/Linux shell, which are documented but hard to understand. This book
    is a collection of essential command-line script recipes along with detailed descriptions
    tuned with practical applications. It covers most of the important commands in
    Linux with a variety of use cases, accompanied by plenty of examples. This book
    helps you to perform complex data manipulations involving tasks such as text processing,
    file management, backups, and more with the combination of few commands.

- en: Basic user experience with any GNU/Linux platform will help you easily follow
    the book. We have tried to keep all the recipes in the book precise and as simple
    to follow as possible. Your curiosity for learning with the Linux platform is
    the only prerequisite for the book. Step-by-step explanations are provided for
    solving the scripting problems explained in the book. In order to run and test
    the examples in the book, an Ubuntu Linux installation is recommended, however,
    any other Linux distribution is enough for most of the tasks. You will find the
    book to be a straightforward reference to essential shell scripting tasks as well
    as a learning aid to code real-world efficient scripts.
