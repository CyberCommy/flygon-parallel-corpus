- en: '*Section 1*, *Mastering C++ Programming*, introducing ​ ​you ​ ​to ​ ​the ​
    ​latest ​ ​features ​ ​in ​ ​C++ ​ ​17 and STL. ​ ​It ​ ​encourages clean ​ ​code
    ​ ​practices ​ ​in ​ ​C++ ​ ​in ​ ​general ​ ​and ​ ​demonstrates ​ ​the ​ ​GUI
    app-development ​ ​options ​ ​in ​ ​C++. ​ ​You’ll ​ ​get ​ ​tips ​ ​on ​ ​avoiding
    ​ ​memory ​ ​leaks using ​ ​smart-pointers. ​*Section 2*, *Mastering C++ Multithreading*,
    *​*you’ll ​ ​see ​ ​how ​ ​multi-threaded ​programming can ​ ​help ​ ​you ​ ​achieve
    ​ ​concurrency ​ ​in ​ ​your ​ ​applications. We start with a brief introduction
    to the fundamentals of multithreading and concurrency concepts. We then take an
    in-depth look at how these concepts work at the hardware-level as well as how
    both operating systems and frameworks use these low-level functions. You will
    learn about the native multithreading and concurrency support available in C++
    since the 2011 revision, synchronization and communication between threads, debugging
    concurrent C++ applications, and the best programming practices in C++.'

- en: '*Section 3*, *C++17 STL Cookbook*,you’ll ​ ​get ​ ​an ​ ​in-depth ​ ​understanding
    ​ ​of ​ ​the ​ ​C++ ​ ​Standard Template ​ ​Library; we show implementation-specific,
    problem-solution approaches that will help you quickly overcome hurdles. You will
    learn the core STL concepts, such as containers, algorithms, utility classes,
    lambda expressions, iterators, and more while working on practical real-world
    recipes. These recipes will help you get the most from the STL and show you how
    to program in a better way.'
