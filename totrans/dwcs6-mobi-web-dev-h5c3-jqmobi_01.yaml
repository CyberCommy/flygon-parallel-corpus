- en: This book covers, in a compressed way, the whole range of cutting edge and advanced
    features available in Dreamweaver CS6\. Our emphasis is on the new features in
    HTML5 that structure content and make it more accessible, on CSS3 styles that
    add transformations (such as rotations) and effects (such as rounded corners)
    to elements, and on mobile design with HTML5 Media Queries and jQuery Mobile.
    Dreamweaver CS6 provides all the important tools for implementing all these features.

    to review (and for those of you new to Dreamweaver, understand) some fundamental
    tools for maximizing productivity in Dreamweaver. Doing this serves two purposes:
    it provides a fast-and-furious overview of the basics of Dreamweaver CS6, and
    probably more importantly, it grounds us all in the protocols that protect the
    integrity of everything else that we are going to cover in this book.'

    the course of this book involve dozens of files. Dozens? Really? Well, count them:
    a few JavaScript files, links to internal and external pages, embedded audios,
    videos, and images, links to CSS files, and embedded content from other pages
    using the iFrame technique. We''re up to dozens already!'

    a file being moved, renamed, or deleted—our page collapses. But if we are working
    within (and following the rules for working in) a Dreamweaver site, Dreamweaver
    keeps track of all the files in all your web pages—for example, embedded image
    files and video clips and links to other web pages—and makes sure all those files
    work together.

    service if you are incorporating that server into a Dreamweaver site only now.

- en: The single most defining element in any web page is the `<body>` tag, since
    it controls all the visible page content. As your stylesheet grows, more specific
    tags will override the `body` tag styling, but the style you apply to the `body`
    tag sets the default look of your page. So, let's use that as an example for how
    to define a style in Dreamweaver.
