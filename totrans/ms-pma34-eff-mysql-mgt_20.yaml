    guidelines for solving some common problems, and provides hints on how to avoid
    them. It also explains how to interact with the development team for support,
    bug reports, and contributions.

- en: A section at the beginning of the `Documentation.html` file (which is included
    with phpMyAdmin's software), discusses system requirements for the particular
    phpMyAdmin version we are using. It's crucial that these requirements be met,
    and that the environment be properly configured so that problems are avoided.

- en: Some problems, looking like phpMyAdmin bugs, are in fact caused by the server
    environment. Sometimes, the web server is not configured to interpret `.php` files
    correctly, or the PHP component inside the web server does not run with the `mysql`
    or `mysqli` extensions. MySQL accounts may be badly configured. This can happen
    on home servers as well as on hosted servers.

    extension is available), which gives information about the MySQL **Client API
    version**.

- en: We can also try other PHP scripts that make a connection to MySQL, to see if
    the problem is more general than just phpMyAdmin not working. As a general rule,
    we should be running the latest stable versions of every component.

    page explains how anyone can contribute, and gives pointers about the project's
    `git` source code repository. A contribution (translation update, patch, new feature,
    and so on) will be considered with a higher priority if it refers to the latest
    code base, and not to an outdated phpMyAdmin version. Another useful page of instructions
    for using Git, which is used for storing the code base, is located at [http://wiki.phpmyadmin.net/pma/Git](http://wiki.phpmyadmin.net/pma/Git).

    localization system, everyone is encouraged to contribute to translations. The
    project is using a translation server equipped with the `Pootle` software, located
    at [https://l10n.cihar.com/projects/phpmyadmin](http://https://l10n.cihar.com/projects/phpmyadmin).
    It's also possible to use this server to translate phpMyAdmin's `Documentation.html`.

    credited in `Documentation.html.`
