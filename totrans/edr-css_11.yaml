    *data*. They are largely useless, transient and too subjective. Instead become
    acquainted with tools and use them to reveal relevant data for your own scenario.
    This is basically the mantra the Chrome Developer relations folks have been promoting
    for years, I believe it was Paul Lewis (more of which below) that coined the term,
    *Tools, not rules* in relation to troubleshooting web performance.

    That said, selector speed is rarely a concern, but if this selector ends up in
    a dynamic webapp where DOM changes are very common, it could have a large effect.
    So, good for many use cases but keep in mind it might become a perf bottleneck
    as the app matures. Something to profile at that point. Cheers*'

    backs this up. Consider this another way. If I give you two piles of 1000 cards,
    each with different names on except for 5 matching ones, it stands to reason it
    will take longer to pair those matching names than if there were only 100, or
    10 cards. Same principal for the browser.

    is normally to target elements as closely as possible, though increasingly Blink
    is smart about which elements will truly be affected by a change to a parent element*.
    So, practically speaking, if you need to affect a change in a DOM element, add
    a class directly above it in the DOM tree if possible, rather than up on the body
    or html node.

    1](apa.html "Appendix 1. CSS Selector Performance"), *CSS Selector Performance *-
    that CSS selectors are rarely a problem with static pages. Plus, attempting to
    second guess which selector will perform well is probably futile.

    are talking lots of JavaScript manipulation) it may not be beyond the realms of
    possibility that CSS selectors could be causing an issue. *I can't speak for all
    of Mozilla, but I think when you're dealing with performance, you want to focus
    on what's slow. Sometimes that will be selectors; usually it will be other things*,

- en: If you've developed on the Web for any non-trivial period of time you will know
    that the answer to most web related questions is *it depends*. I hate that there
    are no simple, cast-iron rules in relation to CSS performance that can be banked
    upon in every situation. I'd genuinely love to write those rules out here in a
    nice little paragraph and believe they would be universally true. But I can't
    because there simply aren't any universal *cast-iron* truths in relation to performance.
    There can't ever be any because there are simply too many variables. Engines update,
    layout methods become optimised, every DOM tree is different, all CSS files are
    different. On and on ad infinitum. You get the picture.

  zh: 如果您在网络上开发了一段时间，就会知道大多数与网络相关的问题的答案是“这取决于情况”。我讨厌在CSS性能方面没有简单的、铁一般的规则可以在任何情况下依赖。我真的很想在这里写出那些规则，并相信它们是普遍适用的。但我不能，因为在性能方面根本没有普遍适用的“铁一般”的真理。永远不可能有，因为变量太多了。引擎更新，布局方法变得更加优化，每个DOM树都不同，所有的CSS文件也都不同。如此循环往复。你明白了吧。
- en: I'm afraid the best I can offer is to not sweat things like CSS selectors or
    layout methods in advance. It's unlikely they will be your problem (but, you know,
    they just might). Instead, concentrate on making *the thing*. Then, when *the
    thing* is made, test *the thing*. If it's slow or broke, find the problem and
    fix *the thing*.
