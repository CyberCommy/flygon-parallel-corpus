- en: '*Mastering KVM Virtualization* is a book that should get you "from zero to
    hero" status in the time it takes for you to go through this book. This book is
    a large collection of everything that KVM has to offer, both for a DevOps and
    regular system administration audience, and developers. It is our hope that, by
    going through this book, you''ll be able to understand everything about the inner
    workings of KVM, as well as the more advanced concepts and everything in between.
    It doesn''t matter if you''re just barely starting with KVM virtualization or
    if you''re already well on the way – you should find some valuable information
    on the pages of this book.'

    Linux Virtualization*, discusses different types of virtualization, hypervisor
    types, and Linux virtualization concepts (Xen and KVM). In this chapter, we try
    to explain some basics of Linux virtualization and how it fits into the cloud

    Solution*, starts with a discussion of virtualization concepts and the need to
    virtualize our environments, explains the basic hardware and software aspects
    of virtualization, and the various approaches to virtualization. In this chapter,
    we start discussing KVM and libvirt, concepts that we''ll use throughout this

    by introducing some new concepts including oVirt, a GUI that can be used to manage
    our virtualized Linux infrastructure. We take you through the process of checking
    whether the hardware used is compatible with KVM, introduce some basic commands
    for virtual machine deployment, and then move on to explain how we''d use oVirt

    explains how libvirt interacts with various networking concepts – virtual switches
    in different modes, how to use CLI tools to manage libvirt networking, TAP and
    TUN devices, Linux bridging, and Open vSwitch. After that, we discuss more extreme
    examples of networking by using SR-IOV, a concept that should get us the lowest
    latency and highest throughput and is used in cases where every single millisecond

    storage pools, NFS, iSCSI, SAN, Ceph, Gluster, multipathing and redundancy, virtual
    disk types, and so on. We also offer you a glimpse into the future of storage

    in terms of getting to know AWS as a concept, which will be key to deploying a
