- en: '*Mastering KVM Virtualization* is a book that should get you "from zero to
    hero" status in the time it takes for you to go through this book. This book is
    a large collection of everything that KVM has to offer, both for a DevOps and
    regular system administration audience, and developers. It is our hope that, by
    going through this book, you''ll be able to understand everything about the inner
    workings of KVM, as well as the more advanced concepts and everything in between.
    It doesn''t matter if you''re just barely starting with KVM virtualization or
    if you''re already well on the way – you should find some valuable information
    on the pages of this book.'

- en: This book is for Linux beginners and professionals alike, as it doesn't necessarily
    require an advanced knowledge of Linux beforehand. We'll get you there as you
    go through the book – it's an integral part of the learning process. If you're
    interested in KVM, OpenStack, the ELK Stack, Eucalyptus, or AWS – we've got you
    covered.

- en: '[*Chapter 1*](B14834_01_Final_ASB_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor016), *Understanding
    Linux Virtualization*, discusses different types of virtualization, hypervisor
    types, and Linux virtualization concepts (Xen and KVM). In this chapter, we try
    to explain some basics of Linux virtualization and how it fits into the cloud
    environment from a high-level perspective.'

- en: '[*Chapter 2*](B14834_02_Final_ASB_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor029), *KVM as a Virtualization
    Solution*, starts with a discussion of virtualization concepts and the need to
    virtualize our environments, explains the basic hardware and software aspects
    of virtualization, and the various approaches to virtualization. In this chapter,
    we start discussing KVM and libvirt, concepts that we''ll use throughout this
    book.'

- en: '[*Chapter 3*](B14834_03_Final_ASB_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor049), *Installing
    KVM Hypervisor, libvirt, and oVirt*, expands on [*Chapter 2*](B14834_02_Final_ASB_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor029)
    by introducing some new concepts including oVirt, a GUI that can be used to manage
    our virtualized Linux infrastructure. We take you through the process of checking
    whether the hardware used is compatible with KVM, introduce some basic commands
    for virtual machine deployment, and then move on to explain how we''d use oVirt
    in the same scenario.'

    explains how libvirt interacts with various networking concepts – virtual switches
    in different modes, how to use CLI tools to manage libvirt networking, TAP and
    TUN devices, Linux bridging, and Open vSwitch. After that, we discuss more extreme
    examples of networking by using SR-IOV, a concept that should get us the lowest
    latency and highest throughput and is used in cases where every single millisecond
    counts.'

    is a big one, as storage concepts are extremely important when building virtualized
    and cloud environments. We discuss every type of storage that KVM supports – local
    storage pools, NFS, iSCSI, SAN, Ceph, Gluster, multipathing and redundancy, virtual
    disk types, and so on. We also offer you a glimpse into the future of storage
    – with NVMe and NVMeoF being some of the technologies discussed.'

    Devices and Protocols*, talks about various virtual machine display types, remote
    protocols including VNC and Spice, as well as NoVNC, which ensures display portability
    as we can use a virtual machine console inside a web browser by using NoVNC.'

    ways of deploying and configuring KVM virtual machines, as well as migration processes,
    which are very important for any kind of production environment.'

    Modifying VM Disks, Templates, and Snapshots*, discusses various virtual machine
    image types, virtual machine templating processes, the use of snapshots, and some
    of the use cases and best practices while using snapshots. It also serves as an
    introduction to the next chapter, where we will be using templating and virtual
    machine disks in a much more streamlined fashion to customize virtual machines
    post-boot by using `cloud-init` and `cloudbase-init`.'

- en: '[*Chapter 9*](B14834_09_Final_ASB_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor165), *Customize
    a Virtual Machine with cloud-init*, discusses one of the most fundamental concepts
    in cloud environments – how to customize a virtual machine image/template post-boot.
    Cloud-init is used in almost all of the cloud environments to do post-boot Linux
    virtual machine configuration, and we explain how it works and how to make it
    work in your environment.'

    Windows Guest Deployment and Customization*, is a continuation of [*Chapter 9*](B14834_09_Final_ASB_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor165),
    with a razor-sharp focus on Microsoft Windows virtual machine templatization and
    post-boot customization. For that, we use cloudbase-init, a concept that''s basically
    the same as cloud-init, but which is suited for Microsoft-based operating systems
    only.'

    Ansible journey – deploying AWX and Ansible, and describes how to use these concepts
    in our KVM-based environments. This is just one of the Ansible usage models that
    is employed in modern-day IT, as the whole DevOps and infrastructure-as-a-code
    story gets much more exposure in IT infrastructure all over the world.'

    KVM with OpenStack*, discusses the process of building cloud environments based
    on KVM. OpenStack is the standard approach to delivering just that when using
    KVM. In this chapter, we talk about all of the OpenStack building blocks and services,
    how to deploy it from scratch, and describe how to use it in production environments.'

    KVM with AWS*, takes us on a journey toward using public and hybrid cloud concepts
    by using **Amazon Web Services** (**AWS**). Like almost all the other chapters,
    this is a heavily hands-on chapter that you can also use to get your feet wet
    in terms of getting to know AWS as a concept, which will be key to deploying a
    hybrid-cloud infrastructure using Eucalyptus at the end of the chapter.'

    the KVM Virtualization Platform*, introduces a very popular concept of monitoring
    via the **Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana** (**ELK**) stack. It also takes you
    through the whole process of setting up and integrating the ELK stack with your
    KVM infrastructure, all the way through to the end result – using dashboards and
    UIs to monitor your KVM-based environment.'

    Tuning and Optimization for KVM VMs*, talks about various approaches to tuning
    and optimization in KVM-based environments by deconstructing all of the infrastructure
    design principles and putting them to (correct) use. We cover a number of advanced
    topics here – NUMA, KSM, CPU and memory performance, CPU pinning, the tuning of
    VirtIO, and block and network devices.'

    services and logging, and explains various troubleshooting methodologies for KVM
    and oVirt, Ansible and OpenStack, Eucalyptus, and AWS. These are the real-life
    problems that we''ve also encountered in our production environments while writing
    this book. In this chapter, we basically discuss problems related to every single
    chapter of this book, including problems associated with snapshots and templating.'
