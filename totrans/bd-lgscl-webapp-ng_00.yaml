- en: If you have been burnt by unreliable JavaScript frameworks before, you will
    be amazed by the maturity of the Angular platform. Angular enables you to build
    fast, efficient, and real-world web apps. In this Learning Path, you'll learn
    Angular and to deliver high-quality and production-grade Angular apps from design
    to deployment.

- en: You will begin by creating a simple fitness app, using the building blocks of
    Angular, and make your final app, Personal Trainer, by morphing the workout app
    into a full-fledged personal workout builder and runner with advanced directive
    building - the most fundamental and powerful feature of Angular.

- en: You will learn the different ways of architecting Angular applications using
    RxJS, and some of the patterns that are involved in it. Later you’ll be introduced
    to the router-first architecture, a seven-step approach to designing and developing
    mid-to-large line-of-business apps, along with popular recipes. By the end of
    this book, you will be familiar with the scope of web development using Angular,
    Swagger, and Docker, learning patterns and practices to be successful as an individual
    developer on the web or as a team in the Enterprise.

- en: We will be building our apps in the TypeScript language; therefore, it would
    be preferable if you have an IDE that makes development with TypeScript easy.
    IDEs such as Atom, Sublime, WebStorm, and Visual Studio (or VS Code) are great
    tools for this purpose.
