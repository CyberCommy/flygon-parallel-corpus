    to Java from a background of working with another programming language, you probably
    know that Java is a language for programming computers. But Java goes beyond just
    that. It's more than a very popular and successful language that is virtually
    present everywhere, it is a collection of technologies. Besides the language,
    it encompasses a very rich ecosystem and it has a vibrant community working on
    many facets to make the ecosystem as dynamic as it can be.

    Java program, an instance of JVM is created. It provides security and isolation
    for the Java program that is running. It prevents the running of the code from
    clashing with other programs within the system. It works like a non-strict sandbox,
    making it safe to serve resources, even in hostile environments such as the internet,
    but allowing interoperability with the computer on which it runs. In simpler terms,
    JVM acts as a *computer inside a computer*, which is meant specifically for running
    Java programs.

    all the base Java classes (the runtime) as well as the libraries for interaction
    with the host system (such as font management, communication with the graphical
    system, the ability to play sounds, and plugins for the execution of Java applets
    in the browser) and utilities (such as the Nashorn JavaScript interpreter and
    the keytool cryptographic manipulation tool). As stated before, the JRE includes
    the JVM.

    many auxiliary tools such as a Java disassembler (`javap`), a utility to create
    packages of Java applications (`jar`), system to generate documentation from source
    code (`javadoc`), among many other utilities. The JDK is a superset of the JRE,
    meaning that if you have the JDK, then you also have the JRE (and the JVM).

- en: This lesson covered the very basics of Java. We saw some of the basic features
    of a Java program, and how we can display or print messages to the console. We
    also saw how we can read values using the input consoles. We also looked at packages
    that can be used to group classes, and saw an example of `Scanner` in `java.util`
    package.
