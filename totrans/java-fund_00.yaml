- en: Since its inception, Java has stormed the programming world. Its features and
    functionalities provide developers with the tools needed to write robust cross-platform
    applications. *Java Fundamentals* introduces you to these tools and functionalities
    that will enable you to create Java programs. The book begins with an introduction
    to the language, its philosophy, and evolution over time, up until the latest
    release. You'll learn how the `javac`/`java` tools work and what Java packages
    are, as well as the way in which a Java program is usually organized. Once you
    are comfortable with this, you'll be introduced to advanced concepts of the language,
    such as control flow keywords. You'll explore object-oriented programming and
    the part it plays in making Java what it is. In the concluding lessons, you'll
    get to grips with classes, typecasting, and interfaces, and gain an understanding
    of the uses of data structures, arrays, and strings; handling exceptions; and
    creating generics.

    tasks, and follow advanced books on algorithms and data structures, or explore
    more advanced Java books.
