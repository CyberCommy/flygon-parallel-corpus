    56k modem. It seemed terrific at the time! Websites were loading very slowly,
    but they were designed to minimize the consumption of data we were using since
    each kbit was calculated as usage (no unlimited internet, ha!). To understand
    how web design works, I strongly think that we need to know the history behind
    it, how developers and designers were designing websites when it first started
    in 1991 with Tim Berners-Lee's first website. The evolution of web design with
    table-based sites, animated text and GIF images, free page builders, and the introduction
    of Flash by Macromedia in 1996 was a significant advancement in the world of web
    design. It will really help you understand the web design principles of why and
    where it was heading. Let's go through these key aspects to have a precise idea
    of how web design has evolved and to analyze its importance in our day-to-day
    life in contemporary society.

    and prevent private companies from building their own web language, as it would
    create chaos on the web. The W3C to this day continues to deliver standards for

- en: Web design became more interesting with the introduction of table markups in
    HTML. Web designers saw the opportunity to structure their design with the original
    table markup (sneaky as they always are). Sites were still text heavy, but at
    least they could separate the content into different columns, rows, and other
    navigation elements. The usage of spacer GIFs, introduced in David's Siegel's
    book *Creating Killer Sites* in 1996, allowed web designers to play with white
    space (basically, small transparent GIFs were placed in between the content),
    and by incorporating a sliced image background, users would have an illusion of
    a simple structure, whereas in reality there was a table layout behind it. Designers
    could finally play around with some graphic design elements as it grew rapidly
    in popularity, such as having visit counters, animated GIFs, and so on. Texts
    and images were literally dancing across websites everywhere.

    1996\. It was like a renaissance for web design. People would probably make fun
    of you if you built your website with Flash today, but back then it was the killer
    tool to create interactive and graphics websites. Designers were able to add animation,
    custom fonts and shapes, 3D buttons, splash pages, and all in one tool-Flash.
    The whole was encapsulated into one file to be read into the user's browser. It
    was like magic. Unfortunately, that magic was inconvenient. It was not **Search
    Engine ****Optimization** (**SEO**)-friendly and was very heavy in terms of resources
    for your computer.

    were also more aware of color distribution, placements, attention to typography,
    and the usage of icons instead of text links. At last, the evolution of Web 2.0
    also saw the growth of SEO, as content driving. These techniques, such as keyword
    optimization, tagging, and inbound and outbound links, are still being used now.
    The web industry really saw the importance of SEO, and this became the main focus
    of web design during this time.

- en: The first time we heard the term *responsive web design*, it was from Ethan
    Marcotte in 2011\. In his book on responsive design, he described a new way of
    designing for the desktop but also for the mobile interface, basically proposing
    to use the same content, but a different layout for the design on each screen.
    The introduction of the 960 grid system also helped this responsive issue ([https://960.gs](https://960.gs)).
    The most popular versions being used were either 12 or 16 columns. It became a
    standard for designers to design their websites using 12 columns for desktop and
    downgrading progressively for mobile viewing. With the introduction of **media
    queries** with CSS3, it became easier for designers to design websites for mobile
    screens.

    the style of design in which elements do not have stylistic shapes and characters,
    such as gradient, drop shadows, textures, and any type of design that makes it
    look real and three dimensional. It's usually described as the opposite of *rich
    design*, which in contrast is used to make elements feel more tactile, real, and
    usable for users when they're navigating.

    movement in many design-related fields. It became a solid foundation for graphic
    design in the mid-20th century around the world. The main characteristics of this
    design style are the use of asymmetric layouts, grids, sans-serif typefaces such
    as Akzidenz Grotesk, and a clean hierarchy of content. The famous typeface Helvetica
    was created during this period and was used in every type of design.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We can without a doubt say that the Swiss Style has had a strong influence on
    the flat design style we know today. However, the main reason for this trend was
    mainly caused by the development of responsive design during this period, where
    developers and designers struggled to implement a design that heavily relied on
    textures, drop-shadows, and background images. Shrinking those patterns for various
    screen sizes and because of browser compatibility constraints was just too much
    for designers. They had to go back to basics and simplify their design and make
    it less texturized. This would result in quicker-loading websites and would be
    more efficient and easier to design.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Being a designer, I saw this trend on the rise. I still remember designers testing
    out the latest features of CSS3 and trying to use as few design assets as possible
    while attempting to create everything by code. The main focus for both developers
    and designers at this time was efficiency and faster loading.

    a major influence and popularized this trend even further. With Microsoft Metro
    and the launch of iOS 7 by Apple, people immediately felt that the so-called rich
    design was completely outdated and quickly found the need for a redesign of their
    website or app.

    remember and keep in mind is that web design trends do not derive from any particular
    person or company. Web design is a mix of visual design (influenced by print design)
    and the technology used on the web. With the advancements made in HTML5 and CSS3,
    we can start to see that design is becoming far more complex as compared to the
    original flat design. Technology now allows people to have more flexibility with
    their design and forms. Let's see how the web design trend will evolve, but keep
    in mind that it evolves quickly, very quickly.
