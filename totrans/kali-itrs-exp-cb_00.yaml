- en: This book reveals the best methodologies and techniques for a penetration testing
    process with the help of Kali Linux. This is a value add for network system admins,
    aiding them to understand the entire security testing methodology. This will help
    protect them from day-to-day attacks by allowing them to find and patch the vulnerability
    beforehand. As penetration testing in corporate environments usually happens on
    an annual basis, this will assist the admins to proactively protect their network
    on a regular basis.

- en: This book covers recipes to get you started with security testing and performing
    your own security assessment in the corporate network or the server being tested.
    By the end of this book, you will have developed a greater skill set and knowledge
    of a complete penetration testing scenario, and you will be able to perform a
    successful penetration test of any network.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To follow the recipes in this book, you will need the latest instance of Kali
    Linux; it can be found at [https://www.kali.org/downloads/](https://www.kali.org/downloads/).
    Detailed installation steps are presented in the readme section of Kali, which
    can be found at [http://docs.kali.org/category/installation](http://docs.kali.org/category/installation).
    For wireless testing, a wireless device will be required; for testing purposes
    we have demonstrated using the alfa awus036h card. Chipsets with similar capabilities
    can be found at [https://www.aircrack-ng.org/doku.php?id=compatibility_drivers](https://www.aircrack-ng.org/doku.php?id=compatibility_drivers).

    can pull the vulnerable image and begin testing. Docker can be installed from [https://www.docker.com/get-docker](https://www.docker.com/get-docker).
    We have also shown how NetHunter can be installed on OnePlus One mobile devices;
    to do the same, a OnePlus One or a Kali NetHunter supported device will be required.
    NetHunter supported devices include the following: Nexus 5, Nexus 6, Nexus 7,
    Nexus 9, Nexus 10, and OnePlus One.'
