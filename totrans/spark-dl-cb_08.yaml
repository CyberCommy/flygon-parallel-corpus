- en: The real estate market is one of the most competitive markets when it comes
    to pricing. This tends to vary significantly based on a number of factors such
    as the location, age of the property, size, and so on. Therefore, it has become
    a modern-day challenge to accurately predict the prices of properties (especially
    those in the housing market) in order to make better investment decisions. This
    chapter will deal with precisely that.

    able to further improve accuracy to 89%.

    accuracy. This is left as an exercise for the reader.
