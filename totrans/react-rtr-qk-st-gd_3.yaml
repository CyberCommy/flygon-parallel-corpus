- en: React-Router provides the `<Link>` and `<NavLink>` components, which allow you
    to navigate to different routes defined in the application. These navigation components
    can be thought of as being like anchor links on the page that allow you to navigate
    to other pages in the site. In a traditional website, when you navigate through
    the application using anchor links, it results in a page refresh, and all the
    components in the page are re-rendered. Navigation links created with `<Link>`
    and `<NavLink>` do not result in a page refresh, and only those certain sections
    of the page that are defined using the `<Route>` and match the URL path are updated.

    can use the prefix `match.url` in the `to` prop. Also, you can programmatically

    Props—`history`, `match`, `location`, and `staticContext`—can be made available
    to components rendered outside the Route context via the `withRouter` higher order
    component. The `'react-router-dom'` package includes a `<Prompt>` component that
    can be used to display a confirmation dialog box when the user tries to navigate
    to route by accidentally clicking on a navigation link. The `<Prompt>` component
    accepts the `when` and `message` prop, and, based on the Boolean value assigned
