- en: React was built by Facebook in order to provide more structure to their code
    base and allow it to scale much better. React worked so well for Facebook that
    they eventually open sourced it. Today, React is one of the most popular JavaScript
    libraries for building frontends. It allows us to build small, isolated, and highly
    reusable components that can be composed together in order to create complex frontends.

- en: TypeScript was built by Microsoft to help developers more easily build large
    frontend applications. It is a superset of JavaScript, bringing a rich type system
    to it. This type system helps developers to catch bugs early and allows tools
    to be created to robustly navigate and refactor code.

    large sophisticated frontends efficiently that are easy to maintain.

- en: '[Chapter 1](372b9509-9775-47b7-88eb-dc68c8a6271f.xhtml), *TypeScript Basics*,
    introduces the TypeScript type system, covering the basic types. It moves on to
    cover how we can configure the incredibly flexible TypeScript compiler. Linting
    and code formatting are also introduced, along with their configuration.'

    3*, steps through the significant new features that were introduced in version
    3 of TypeScript. Tuples feature heavily in this chapter, along with the closely
    related rest and spread syntax and how we can use these constructs with strong
    types. Setting up multiple related TypeScript projects efficiently is also covered,
    before moving on to improvements that have been made when setting default prop
    values in a React component.'

- en: '[Chapter 3](6938e951-47cf-4751-9cfc-c5afcdd73c9e.xhtml), *Getting Started with
    React and TypeScript*, begins with how projects that use both these technologies
    can be created. The chapter then introduces how strongly-typed React components
    can be built in both a class-based and functional manner. Managing state and hooking
    into life cycle events are also key topics in this chapter.'

    Router*, introduces a library that can help us efficiently create an app with
    multiple pages. It covers how to create page links, and declare the components
    that should be rendered. Step by step, the chapter covers how to implement route
    parameters, query parameters, and nested routes. The chapter also covers how to
    load components from a route on demand in order to optimize performance in apps
    entailing lots of large pages.'

    focuses solely on TypeScript types. On this occasion, more advanced, but still
    very useful, types are covered, such as generic types, union types, overload signatures,
    and keyof and lookup types.'

    covers a number of common patterns for building React components while still maintaining
    strong types. Container components are stepped through first, followed by composite
    components. The popular render props pattern and higher-order components are also
    covered in this chapter.'

    form component is built step by step, including validation and submission.'

    how this popular library can help manage state across an app. A strongly typed
    Redux store is built with actions and reducers. The chapter finishes by looking
    at how a new React function can allow a Redux style structure within components
    without Redux.'

    open source library is looked at to make tests less brittle when the internals
    of components are refactored. Some of the great features of Jest are stepped through,
