- en: The world has been waiting for Java 9 for a long time. More specifically, we've
    been waiting for the Java Platform Module System, and Java 9 is finally going
    to deliver it. If all goes as planned, we'll finally have true isolation, giving
    us, potentially, smaller JDKs and more stable applications. That's not all that
    Java 9 is offering of course; there is a plethora of great changes in the release,
    but that's certainly the most exciting. That said, this book is not a book about
    the module system. There are plenty of excellent resources that can give you a
    deep dive into the Java Platform Module System and its many implications. This
    book, though, is a much more practical look at Java 9\. Rather than discussing
    the minutiae of the release, as satisfying as that can be, what we'll do over
    the next few hundred pages is look at different ways all of the great changes
    in recent JDK releases--especially Java 9--can be applied in practical ways.
