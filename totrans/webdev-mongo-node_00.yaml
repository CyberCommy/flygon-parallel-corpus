- en: With the advent of ECMAscript 6, the usability of Node.JS has a great scope
    for future and has already been implemented today. The need of learning es6 syntactic
    sugar and inclusion of most of the cross-technology features inspires different
    technological communities to learn JavaScript.

    solution called MongoDB cater to building fast, scalable network applications
    easily. This combination makes managing any form of data easy and ensures its
    delivery speed.

    Node.JS and MongoDB that is used to build an isomorphic server-side rendering
    web application. This books also guides us in creating a configurable Node.JS
    server using hapi.js and learning to develop a single-page frontend app using
    Angular 4.

- en: This book will begin by introducing you to the groundwork needed to set up the
    development environment and a comparative study on how the new ECMAscript is different
    from the traditional JavaScript. Once the base is ready, we will quickly run through
    the steps necessary to get the main application server up and running and to learn
    the Node.JS core.

    ViewModels to generate reusable code that reduces development time. The development
    ends with learning proper testing concepts and how to automate them for reusability
    and maintainability.
