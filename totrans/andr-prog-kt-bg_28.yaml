    you will be able to show to friends and family and that explore areas of Android
    that are new to you. If you are confident about these apps, you could upload them
    to Google Play. If you are worried about how they might be received by reviewers,
    then make them free and put a note in the description about it being "just a prototype,"
    or something similar.

    is a gap in your knowledge that needs to be filled to make some feature come to
    life. This is normal and guaranteed; don't let it put you off. Think of how to
    describe the problem and search for the solution on Google.

    practical and maintainable size. This is a sign that there is a better way to

    see how they have solved problems. This is useful, because seeing the file structure
    of classes, and then dipping into them, often shows how to plan your apps from
    the start and prevent you from starting off on the wrong path. You can even get
    a GitHub app that allows you to do this from the comfort of your phone or tablet.

    sample code, so the community can respond with answers. In my experience however,
    it is rarely necessary to post a question because there is almost always somebody
    who has had the exact same problem.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: StackOverflow is especially good for bleeding-edge issues. If a new Android
    Studio version has a bug, or a new version of the Android API seems to not be
    doing what it should, then you can be almost certain that a few thousand other
    developers around the world are having the same problem as you. Then, some smart
    coder, often from the Android development team itself, will be there with an answer.

    start of this book that there were very few, arguably no, books that taught Android
    programming to readers with no Kotlin experience. That was the reason I wrote
    this book.

    to app design and the Android API, you are well-placed to read the Android "beginner"
    books for people who already know how to program in Kotlin, just like you do now.
