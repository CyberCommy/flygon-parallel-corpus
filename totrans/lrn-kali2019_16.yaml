    their network perimeter is enough to safeguard their assets. Having a single network
    firewall is simply a single-layer defense; there are many ways in which attacks
    can bypass the security systems and controls within a corporate network. One technique
    that is commonly used is to manipulate a person into doing something or revealing
    confidential information to the attacker. This is known as **social engineering**.

    to convince a person into revealing sensitive (confidential) information. Social
    engineering can be performed against the corporate help desk, administrative team,
    IT staff, executive team, and so on. Any employee with access to valuable corporate
    information is definitely a prime target; the challenge is to manipulate the victim
    into believing everything you are saying and to gain their trust. Once the victim's
    trust has been obtained, the next stage is to exploit it.

    effective in preventing a social engineering attack. Let's imagine that a penetration
    tester calls at the help desk of an organization, pretending to be one of the
    senior managers requesting to change the password of their corporate user account.
    The help desk staff may not ask the caller to provide further verification regarding
    their identity and may just perform the task and provide the new password to the
    user account over the phone. The attacker can now use these user credentials to
    gain access to email accounts and the remainder of the corporate network.

    authority. The attacker sometimes poses as a legitimate end user by providing
    a false identity and asking for confidential information. Additionally, the attacker
    can pretend to be an important user in the organization, such as a director or
    senior member of staff, and request a password change on the victim's user account.
    An easy form of impersonation that usually gets a user to trust you quickly is
    posing as technical support. Imagine calling an employee while you're pretending
    to be an IT tech and requesting the user to provide their user account details.
    Usually, end users are not always aware of human-based threats in cybersecurity
    and would quickly trust someone who is pretending to be technical support.

- en: During the course of this chapter, we discussed various forms of social engineering
    techniques and methods of defending a person and organizations against them. We
    took a look at the identifying characteristics of phishing emails and a couple
    of social engineering tools that come preinstalled with Kali Linux. Now that you
    have completed this chapter, you will be able to describe various forms of social
    engineering attacks, implement countermeasures to reduce the risk of being a victim
    of such attacks, and perform a computer-based attack to capture a victim's user
    credentials by mimicking a social networking website.
