- en: C++ is one of the most widely used programming languages. It is fast, flexible,
    and efficient which is used to solve many programming problems.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The objective of this Learning Path is to make you familiar and comfortable
    with C++. You will become familiar with the constructs of the C++ programming
    by learning about the language structures, functions, and classes which will help
    you identify the execution flow through the code. You will explore and understand
    the importance of the C++ standard library as well as memory allocation for writing
    better and faster programs.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This Learning Path also deals with understanding the challenges that come with
    advanced C++ programming. You will learn about advanced topics such as multithreading,
    networking, concurrency, performance, meta-programming, lambda expressions, regular
    expressions, testing, and many more in the form of recipes.
