- en: Welcome to this chapter! We'll assume that you either enjoyed the first chapter
    so much that you have decided to continue, or you skipped it because you felt
    comfortable with what you already know. Well, in either case, here is your first
    question. The average user will buy a wireless router and not configure any wireless
    security. Why do you think that is?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Well, of course, you knew it all along, it's because the average user may not
    be aware of the security features or precautions on the device or they may be
    computer literate but not know how to implement wireless security. This is where
    **Wi-Fi Protected Setup** (**WPS**) comes into play.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: WPS allows easy configuration on a wireless home network. The user simply presses
    a button on the wireless router and then the wireless router automatically configures
    a secure network for the user. Sounds great right? Wrong! Most common wireless
    routers fall victim to brute-force attacks. A WPS PIN usually consists of just
    numbers. This security flaw allows an attacker to recover or crack the WPS PIN
    in just a few hours by using brute-force techniques.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It isn't just users, but even companies and ISPs are doing this. They will simply
    plug in the wireless router and press the WPS button and write down the key for
    you. This is extremely bad security, especially on a business network! Please
    take the time to change the username, change the default password, turn off remote
    management, and turn on the firewall.

    testing. These steps are known for testing methodologies such as PTES, NIST 800-115,
    and OSSTMM. You can perform these actions in a virtualized environment to help
    test out exploits on vulnerabilities before taking action on a productive network.
    It also helps identify the root cause of an issue through penetration testing.

    This also provides easy access for hackers to attack and gain access to your internal
    network. From the inside, they can cause heavy damage and compromise sensitive
    corporate and customer information. Whether they park outside, in front of the
    building, or drive around the facility, hackers can find ways to get into your
    network. Following the wireless penetration testing methodology will help identify
    vulnerabilities and offer solutions for hardening and remediation.

    Phishing is a fraudulent attempt to gather sensitive information such as usernames,
    passwords, social security numbers, phone numbers, and credit cards. These attacks
    are commonly identified through e-mail directly to a user who is told to visit
    a website regarding an update to their information, password change, or verifying
    information. The best way to protect yourself from a phishing scheme is to learn
    how they work. An e-mail asking for your password or changing your password from
    an unknown sender is most likely a fake e-mail. These e-mails will then need to
    be blocked or flagged as phishing or spam. If you believe you are a victim of
    phishing, immediately change your passwords and security questions to prevent
    any damage or lost information in your online account.

    captured 802.11 LEAP packets by using a dictionary attack tool to crack the NT
    password hash. This depends on the password strength, if it is very good, it is
    unlikely to get cracked, which is why it is extremely important to have a mix
    of letters, numbers, and symbols to prevent these dictionary attacks. Tools such
    as Anwrap, Asleap, and THC-LEAPcracker can perform these attacks. An example is
    shown in the following screenshot:'

- en: '802.11 requires EAP to send messages between the user that is connecting and
    the authentication. If an attacker can position themselves between the client
    and the authentication, then the user connecting gets connected to the network.
    The attacker forces a wireless 802.11 device or server to offer a weaker type
    of authentication by using a forged EAP-Response/NAK packets. Since the authentication
    is so weak, it just takes a few minutes for the attacker to quickly gain access.
    Tools such as File2air and libradiate can perform these attacks. An example is
    shown in the following screenshot:'

    types of new threats posed every day. Criminals use new malware and social engineering
    attacks to target weak users and organizations. End users connect over Wi-Fi and
    surf the Internet using a web browser. We will discuss the most common attacking
    methods that cyber criminals use on today's networks in the upcoming sections.

    quickly download music, videos, e-books, and more. If a user downloads from unknown
    sources, they could pose a serious threat to not just their computer, but their
    entire network. Downloading is dangerous because most downloads do not require
    the user's permission.

    hyperlink, it usually redirects them to their web browser to view it; however,
    if the hyperlink is redirecting to malware, it will instantly download and execute
    on the computer. The best thing you can do when downloading is to consider your
    source. Is it a legitimate website? Can you trust it? If not, you shouldn't be
    visiting the site, let alone be downloading files from it.

- en: The best way to protect yourself against the many threats is strong endpoint
    protection such as frequent updates and upgrades, system configuration, monitoring
    regularly for vulnerabilities, and connecting to a strong VPN service. If you
    have full responsibilities over IT in your organization, your staff members should
    be well educated to understand the dangers behind cyber criminals and know good
    security measures to take while using the computers and phone systems.

    or play games online. These employees need to be monitored at all times. All it
    takes is one click and you could be easily running into a catastrophic situation.
    With criminals continuing to update their malware and discovering zero-day vulnerabilities,
    it's always a good idea to run a network audit at least once a month and stay
    informed via e-mail or RSS feeds.

- en: When connecting to a public wireless hotspot, always connect using a VPN service.
    I can't stress enough how important this is. If you don't use a VPN, all of your
    Internet traffic is unencrypted through the entire network. If an attacker happens
    to be on that same network as you, your login credentials, credit cards, and banking
    information could all be in the hands of a hacker. That hacker will most likely
    either use it themselves for their own gain or will sell it on the black market.

- en: My strategy is to always ask myself one question with questions that follow
    it. For example, someone tells you they got software for free without paying for
    it on the Internet and want to share it with you. They explain to you that you
    have to turn off your antivirus because of a crack that needs to be run on it.
    Would you install this software? I absolutely hope not. Trust is a huge problem
    and probably one of the hardest things to do in both the IT world and real life.

    penetration, client-side attacks, entering the network, vulnerability assessments,
    and exploitation and data capture to run a successful wireless penetration test.
    The key elements used in security are firewalls. Proper configuration is the key
    to providing services to your users at a secure level.'

    off with it than without it. It's a dangerous situation to think that you are
    secure when you really aren't at all. As networks become more complex, you will
    want to make sure you use VPNs and tunneling protocols to ensure secure remote
    access.

    The wireless attacking techniques included, but were not limited to, access control
    attacks, confidential attacks, credential attacks, authentication attacks, and
    issues with wireless networks. We created full awareness of what potential threats
    are available to the user. The key points here are to understand what threats
    we are exposed to when connecting to wireless access points and the Internet.
