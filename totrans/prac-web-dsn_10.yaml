    a real impact on your user's engagement, because nobody wants to wait for a website
    to load. We've added a few plugins and a lot of images. Now, let's start optimizing
    our website and make our users love our website even more by using some techniques
    for speeding up upload times. There are two very basic things we can do, which
    are to optimize heavy images and to minify CSS and jQuery code. Let's do that.

    are usually by far the more heavy content of our webpage. Some of our images are
    quite heavy, such as our hero image, which is more than 480KB. All of these images,
    combined with when we download the website, take a long time. Imagine someone
    with a slow internet connection on a smartphone who is trying to download this
    site. This would take them forever. So, let's reduce the file sizes. As a first
    step, we can reduce the actual image size.

    readers to read websites for blind users, for instance. There is an official tool

    top search results. If your content is not great and your users don't want to
    read it, then it is not worth anything, even though you're so highly ranked. Also,
    keep providing new content if you can so that your visitors want to keep coming
    back for more. The next thing you need to do is place keywords strategically in
    your content. This is key to performing well in search ranking because keywords
    are what users actually use to find you. Be careful, though; don't overuse keywords,
    since search engines consider that as keyword spamming, and they may penalize
    you. Use keywords in a title, meta-description tag, headings, and links.

    should have a strategy to increase the quantity and quality of backlinks to your

    walked through the process of launching our website. From creating our favicon,
    compressing our images, minifying our CSS and JS files, we have also managed to
    validate our HTML with W3 Markup Validator. Followed by the purchase of our domain
    name and the upload of our files to our server. We finished the chapter by integrating
    Google Analytics and submitting our website to Google Search. It was a very condensed
    chapter we can say it!
