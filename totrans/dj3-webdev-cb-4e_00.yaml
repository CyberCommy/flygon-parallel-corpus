- en: The Django framework was specifically engineered to help developers construct
    robust, powerful web applications quickly and efficiently. It takes much of the
    tedious work and repetition out of the process, solving questions such as project
    structure, database object-relational mapping, templating, form validation, sessions,
    authentication, security, cookie management, internationalization, basic administration,
    and an interface to access data from scripts. Django is built upon the Python
    programming language, which itself enforces clear and easy-to-read code. Besides
    the core framework, Django has been designed to enable developers to create third-party
    modules that can be used in conjunction with your own apps. Django has an established
    and vibrant community where you can find source code, get help, and contribute.

- en: '*Django 3 Web Development Cookbook, Fourth Edition,* will guide you through
    every stage of the web development process with the Django 3.0 framework. We start
    with the configuration and structuring of the project. Then, you will learn how
    to define the database structure with reusable components, and how to manage it
    throughout the lifetime of your project. The book will move on to the forms and
    views used to enter and list the data. We''ll proceed with responsive templates
    and JavaScript to augment the user experience. Then we will enhance Django''s
    template system with custom filters and tags to be more flexible for frontend
    development. After this, you will tailor the administration interface in order
    to simplify the workflow of content editors. From there, we shift focus to the
    stability and robustness of your project, helping to secure and optimize your
    apps. Next, we examine how to efficiently store and manipulate hierarchical structures.
    Then we will demonstrate that collecting data from different sources and providing
    your own data to others in a range of formats is simpler than you might think.
    We will then introduce you to some tricks for programming and debugging your Django
    project code. We will move on with a few of the available options for testing
    your code. Just before the end of the book, we will show you how to deploy your
    project to production. Lastly, we will complete the development cycle by setting
    common maintenance practices.'

- en: In contrast to many other Django books, which are concerned only with the framework
    itself, this book covers several important third-party modules that will equip
    you with the tools necessary for complete web development. Additionally, we provide
    examples using the Bootstrap frontend framework and the jQuery JavaScript library,
    both of which simplify the creation of advanced and complex user interfaces.
