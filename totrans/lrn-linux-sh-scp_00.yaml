- en: Shell scripts allow us to program commands in chains and have the system execute
    them as a scripted event, just like batch files. This book will start with an
    overview of Linux and Bash shell scripting, and then quickly deep dive into helping
    you set up your local environment, before introducing you to tools that are used
    to write shell scripts. The next set of chapters will focus on helping you understand
    Linux under the hood and what Bash provides the user. Soon, you will have embarked
    on your journey along the command line. You will now begin writing actual scripts
    instead of commands, and will be introduced to practical applications for scripts.
    The final set of chapters will deep dive into the more advanced topics in shell
    scripting. These advanced topics will take you from simple scripts to reusable,
    valuable programs that exist in the real world. The final chapter will leave you
    with some handy tips and tricks and, as regards the most frequently used commands,
    a cheat sheet containing the most interesting flags and options will also be provided.

- en: After completing this book, you should feel confident about starting your own
    shell scripting projects, no matter how simple or complex the task previously
    seemed. We aim to teach you *how* to script and *what* to consider, to complement
    the clear-cut patterns that you can use in your daily scripting challenges.

- en: This book targets new and existing Linux system administrators, as well as Windows
    system administrators or developers who are interested in automating administrative
    tasks. No prior shell scripting experience is required, but if you do possess
    some experience, this book will quickly turn you into a pro. Readers should have
    a (very) basic understanding of the command line.

    you for the remainder of the book. Aided by some background in Linux and Bash,
    you should be better able to understand how and why shell scripting can provide
    clear benefits to you.'

    throughout the rest of the book. You will be shown how to set up an Ubuntu 18.04
    Linux virtual machine on your local machine, using VirtualBox. This virtual machine
    will be used to write, run, and debug commands and scripts in this book.'

    Tools*, introduces you to the tools that will be used to write shell scripts.
    Two different kinds of tools will be described: IDE editors (Atom, Notepad++),
    and terminal-based editors (vim and nano). You will be encouraged to initially
    write scripts in an IDE, and troubleshoot scripts in a terminal-based editor,
    to most resemble real-world use.'

    coves how the Linux filesystem is organized by exploring the virtual machine created
    in the previous chapters. You will achieve this by performing your first command-line
    actions, such as `cd`, `pwd`, and `ls`. Context regarding the different structures
    will be provided so that you can use this information when writing scripts. And,
    most importantly, the concept of everything is a file will be explained.'

    again by exploring the virtual machine. Commands such as `sudo`, `chmod`, and
    `chown` will be used to interactively learn about file and directory privileges.
    The skills acquired in this chapter will be heavily used in shell scripting, so
    it is imperative that you gain exposure to both the successful execution of commands
    as well as failure messages.'

    are used by Bash, and where the differences lie between parameters and arguments.
