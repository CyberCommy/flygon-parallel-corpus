    Linux-based server or workstation. Our goal is to make it harder for the bad guys
    to do nasty things to your systems.

    a Virtual Environment*, gives an overview of the IT security landscape, and will
    inform the reader of why learning Linux security would be a good career move.
    We''ll also cover how to set up a lab environment for performing hands-on exercises.
    We''ll also show how to set up a virtualized lab environment for performing the
    hands-on labs.'

    covers the dangers of always using the root user account, and will introduce the
    benefits of using sudo, instead. We''ll then cover how to lock down normal user
    accounts, and ensure that the users use good-quality passwords.'

    Hardening*, makes sure that important information—both at rest and in transit—are
    safeguarded with proper encryption. For data-in-transit, the default Secure Shell
    configuration is anything but secure, and could lead to a security breach if left
    as is. This chapter shows how to fix that.'

    Access Control*, covers how to set ownership and permissions on files and directories.
    We''ll also cover what SUID and SGID can do for us, and the security implications
    of using them. We''ll wrap things up by covering Extended File Attributes.'

    and Shared Directory Management*, explains that normal Linux file and directory
    permissions settings aren''t very granular. With Access Control Lists, we can
    allow only a certain person to access a file, or we can allow multiple people
    to access a file with different permissions for each person. We''re also going
    to put what we''ve learned together in order to manage a shared directory for
    a group.'

    Access Control with SELinux and AppArmor*, talks about SELinux, which is a Mandatory
    Access Control technology that is included with Red Hat-type Linux distros. We''ll
    give a brief introduction here about how to use SELinux to prevent intruders from
    compromising a system. AppArmor is another Mandatory Access Control technology
    that is included with Ubuntu and Suse-type Linux distros. We''ll give a brief
    introduction here about how to use AppArmor to prevent intruders from compromising
    a system.'

    and Hardening*, discusses that viruses aren''t yet a huge problem for Linux users,
    but they are for Windows users. If your organization has Windows clients that
    access Linux fileservers, then this chapter is for you. You can use auditd to
    audit, which accesses either files, directories, or system calls. It won''t prevent
    security breaches, but it will let you know if some unauthorized person is trying
    to access a sensitive resource. SCAP, the Security Content Application Protocol,
    is a compliance framework that''s promulgated by the National Institute of Standards
    and Technology. OpenSCAP, the open source implementation, can be used to apply
    a hardening policy to a Linux computer.'

    anything since we''ve already learned how to configure our systems for best security.

- en: For hardware, you don't need anything fancy. All you need is a machine that's
    capable of running 64-bit virtual machines. So, you can use any host machine that
    runs with almost any modern CPU from either Intel or AMD. (The exception to this
    rule is with Intel Core i3 and Core i5 CPUs. Even though they're 64-bit CPUs,
    they lack the hardware acceleration that's needed to run 64-bit virtual machines.
    Ironically, Intel Core 2 CPUs and AMD Opteron CPUs that are much older work just
    fine.) For memory, I'd recommend at least 8 Gigabytes.
