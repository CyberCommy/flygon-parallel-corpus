- en: Fun is the keyword that creates the necessity for entertainment in life. There
    are many platforms made for entertainment, and games are one of those platforms.
    There are many types of games available around the world. There were times when
    gaming was limited to sports, board games, card games, and the like. Then, games
    entered the digital domain with specific gaming devices. Gradually, they have
    come to the mobile platform now. Android is one of the most promising platforms.
    The Android market is growing each day and Android gaming is growing with it.

- en: This book is mainly aimed at game programmers. Many people consider game programming
    the same as any other programming job. However, my personal opinion differs—game
    programming is not about sitting with an open code editor and typing in a computer
    language, it's about creating a medium of spreading entertainment.

- en: This book is focused on the technical part of developing a game, especially
    for Android. It will help a developer create games in a better way. Game programming
    is far more logical than technical. I have tried to clear that logic in this book
    with my experiences throughout my career so far.
