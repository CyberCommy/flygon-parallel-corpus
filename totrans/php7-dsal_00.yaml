- en: Data structures and algorithms are an integral part of software application
    development. Whether we are building a web-based application, a CMS, or a standalone
    backend system using PHP, we need to apply algorithms and data structures all
    the time. Sometimes, we do that without noticing and sometimes without giving
    proper attention to it. Most developers think that these two topics are really
    difficult and there is no point in paying attention to details as PHP has lots
    of built-in support for data structures and algorithms. In this book, we will
    focus on the basics and practical examples of PHP data structures and algorithms
    so that we know what data structures are, why to choose them, and where to apply
    which algorithms. This book is designed for novice as well as experienced PHP
    programmers. The book starts from basic topics and moves on to more advanced topics.
    We have tried to accommodate lots of examples with images and explanations in
    this book so that you can understand the concepts properly in visual form and
    with practical examples.
