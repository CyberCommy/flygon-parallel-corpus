    portable and you can run Windows apps in Docker with no code changes. Docker helps
    you meet the biggest challenges in IT: modernizing legacy apps, building new apps,
    moving to the cloud, adopting DevOps and staying innovative.'

- en: This book teaches you all you need to know about Docker on Windows, from the
    101 to running highly-available workloads in production. You'll be guided through
    a Docker journey, starting with the key concepts and simple examples of .NET Framework
    and .NET Core apps in Docker containers on Windows. Then you'll learn how to use
    Docker to modernize the architecture and development of traditional ASP.NET and
    SQL Server apps.

- en: The examples show you how to break up legacy monolithic applications into distributed
    apps and deploy them to a clustered environment in the cloud, using the exact
    same artifacts you use to run them locally. You'll see how to build a CI/CD pipeline
    which uses Docker to compile, package, test and deploy your applications. To help
    you move confidently to production, you'll learn about Docker security, and the
    management, and support options.
