- en: Parts of this book require software that is only available for macOS. While
    React Native development can be done on a Windows machine, certain aspects, such
    as running your applications on iOS devices and in the iOS simulator, or editing
    native code with Xcode, can only be done with a Mac.

- en: There are many ways for a developer to build an app for iOS or Android. React
    Native stands out as one of the most stable, performant, and developer-friendly
    options for building hybrid mobile apps. Developing mobile apps with React Native
    allows developers to build iOS and Android apps in a single code base, with the
    added ability for code-sharing between the two platforms.

- en: Even better, a developer with experience in building web apps in React will
    be ahead of the game, since many of the same patterns and conventions are carried
    over into React Native. If you've had experience of building web apps with React,
    or another framework based on **Model**, **View**, **Component** (**MVC**), you'll
    feel right at home building mobile apps in React Native.

- en: 'There are currently two widely-used ways to create and develop a React Native
    app: with pure React Native using the React Native CLI, or with Expo ([www.expo.io](http://www.expo.io)),
    which is a comprehensive set of tools, libraries, and services for developing
    React Native applications. Unless you need access to certain, often more advanced
    features of React Native, Expo is my recommendation for React Native development.
    Expo has many features that improve the development experience, such as access
    to more native functionality via the Expo SDK, a more flexible and friendly CLI,
    and a browser-based GUI for common dev tasks. This is why all of the recipes in
    this book that do not require pure React Native are implemented using Expo. For
    more on the differences between React Native and Expo, check out the *React Native
    development tools* section in Chapter 10, *App Workflow and Third-Party Plugins*.'

    problems you'll likely face when building a wide variety of apps. Each chapter
    is presented as a series of step-by-step recipes that each explain how to build
    a single feature of an overall app.

- en: React Native is an evolving language. At the time of writing, it's still in
    the 0.5x stage of the development life cycle, so there are some things that will
    change in the months and years to come. Best practices could morph into stale
    ideas, or the open source packages highlighted here could fall out of favor. Every
    recipe in this book has been updated and revised from its counterpart in the first
    edition, both to account for updates to the development process and to improve
    clarity. I've done all I could to keep this text as up to date as possible, but
    technology moves fast, so it's impossible for a book to keep up by itself. The
    repository for all of the code covered in this book is hosted on  GitHub at .
    If you find anything in the code here that doesn't seem to be working correctly,
    you can submit an issue. Or, if you've got a better way to do something, consider
    submitting a pull request!

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book has been designed with beginner to intermediate level React Native
    developers in mind. Even if you don't have a lot of experience with web development,
    the JavaScript found in this book should hopefully never be over your head. I've
    tried to avoid complexity wherever possible, to keep the focus on the lesson being
    taught within a given recipe.

- en: This book also assumes the developer works on a computer running macOS. While
    it is technically possible to develop React Native apps using Windows or Linux,
    there are a number of limitations that make macOS machines much more preferable
    for React Native development, including the abilities to work with native iOS
    code via Xcode, run iOS code on the iOS simulator, and work with the most robust
    development tools for React Native app development.
