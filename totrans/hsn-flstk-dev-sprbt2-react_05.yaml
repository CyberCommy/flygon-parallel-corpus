    with React. This chapter is needed to be able to start frontend development. We
    will create a simple starter React app by using the Create React App starter kit
    made by Facebook.

    If you open Extension Manager from the activity bar, you can search for different

    which we recommend installing. It has multiple code snippets available for the
    React.js app, which make your development process faster. We will show you later
    how to use that extension. This is just one of many useful extensions and you
    should explore more extensions that might makes your life easier. For example,
    the ESLint extension helps you to find typos and syntax errors quickly and makes
    the formatting of the source code easier:'

    development with React.js. First, we installed the Node.js and VS Code editor.
    Then we used the `create-react-app` starter kit to create our first React.js app.
    Finally, we ran the app and demonstrated how to modify it. This is just an overview
    of the app structure and modification, and we will continue this in the following
    chapters.
