- en: PHP grew in to a very popular web programming language due to its simplicity
    and ease of use. One of the key factors of this growing success is the built-in
    possibility to access many popular relational database management systems (RDBMS),
    such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQLite, to name just a few. Today, most of the
    existing and newly created web applications interconnect with these databases
    to produce dynamic, data-driven websites.

- en: While most PHP-enabled web servers are still running PHP versions prior to 5.0,
    the enhancements and performance improvements introduced with this new version
    will lead to wide acceptance of PHP 5 at all levels during coming years. This
    imposes the need to start familiarizing ourselves with all the advanced features
    available in this version today.

- en: This book is targeted at PHP programmers, who are considering migrating to PHP
    5 and using the new database connection abstraction library, PHP Data Objects.
    While PDO is fully object oriented, the familiarity with this programming paradigm
    is required. Novice users who are not familiar with PHP 5's object-oriented features
    may consider reading Appendix A first so that they can follow the code examples
    in this book.

- en: We assume that the reader is familiar with SQL, at the level of creating tables
    and making simple SELECT queries as well as updates. Our examples are based on
    MySQL and SQLite databases as these are the most used options and the only ones
    available at most cheap hosting providers.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: At the end of this book we will present a more advanced example which may be
    of interest to expert programmers with deeper knowledge of SQL and programming
    concepts.
