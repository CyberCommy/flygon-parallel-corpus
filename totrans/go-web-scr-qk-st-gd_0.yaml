- en: The internet is a place full of interesting information and insights just waiting
    to be gleaned. Much like golden nuggets, these fragmented pieces of data can be
    collected, filtered, combined, and refined to produce extremely valuable products.
    Armed with the right knowledge, skills, and a little creativity, you can build
    a web scraper that can power multi-billion-dollar companies. To support this,
    you need to use the best tools for the job, starting with a programming language
    built for speed, simplicity, and safety.

- en: The Go programming language combines the best ideas from its predecessors and
    cutting-edge ideology, leaving out the unnecessary fluff, to produce a razor-sharp
    set of tools and clean architecture. With the Go standard library and projects
    from open source contributors, you have everything you need to build a web scraper
    of any size.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In order to get the most from this book, you should familiarize yourself with
    your Terminal or Command Prompt, ensure you have a good internet connection, and
    read each chapter, even if you think you already know it. The readers of this
    book should keep an open mind as to how they think a web scraper should act, and
    they should learn the current best practices and proper etiquette. This book also
    focuses on the Go programming language, covering the installation, basic commands,
    the standard library, and package management, so some familiarity with Go will
    be helpful as this book covers the language in a broad sense and only goes into
    the depth that is needed for web scraping. To be able to run most of the code
    in this book, the reader should be familiar with their Terminal or Command Prompt
    in order to run the examples, among other tasks.
