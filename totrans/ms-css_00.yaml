- en: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are the three core languages of the web. The more
    you know about all three of them, the better off you'll be. Of these three, the
    role of CSS is as the presentation language of the web. It describes things such
    as the colors, fonts, and layout of your pages.

- en: There are some basic prerequisites for this book. I expect you understand how
    to write HTML, and understand basic CSS including styling fonts, adding margins,
    padding and background colors, and other things, such as what a hexadecimal color
    code is. In the coming chapters, I'll cover some of the basic concepts such as
    the box model, display properties, and types of style sheet. I'll also touch on
    a small amount of JavaScript and jQuery. You don't need any prior knowledge of
    these, but you will be getting a taste of them in this book.

    CSS, we''ll finish building the following HTML5 website, which is all about sharks.
    I say *finish* building this site because the basic HTML and CSS will already
    be in place, and you can download them from the download package for this book.
    We''ll add all the things that I will show you, and more. This site features modular
    and reusable CSS, which you will learn about as we move through the book. The
    site will first be built with floats for layout, before we rewrite the layout
    using flexbox. And we use web fonts for our text:'

    HTML. So, we'll be working in HTML quite a bit. The goal is to use very clean,
