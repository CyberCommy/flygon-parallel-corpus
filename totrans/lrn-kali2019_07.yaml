- en: Beginning a career in ethical hacking and/or penetration testing can be very
    exciting and, most of the time, our minds will be a bit overwhelmed, causing us
    to visit only the chapters about exploiting a system in a book such as this. However,
    conducting a penetration test is like starting a new project at home. Before you
    build a pool in your backyard, there are a few things you must consider, such
    as the space that's available, the cost of materials, the contractor's fees, and
    other details. Information gathering is a very important phase of the hacking
    life cycle and penetration testing.

    important phase of a penetration test since this is when the ethical hacker or
    penetration tester conducts extensive research into gathering as much information
    about the target as possible. Furthermore, footprinting will help create a profile

    in relation to a target. In footprinting, the objective is to obtain specific
    details about the target, such as its operating systems and the service versions
    of running applications. The information that's collected can be used in various
    ways to gain access to the target system, network, or organization. Footprinting
    allows a penetration tester to understand the security posture of the target infrastructure,
    quickly identify security vulnerabilities on the target systems and networks,
    create a network map of the organization, and reduce the area of focus to the
    specific IP addresses, domain names, and the types of devices regarding which
    information is required.

- en: Passive information gathering is when you use an indirect approach to obtain
    information about your target. This method obtains information that's publicly
    available from many sources, thus eliminating direct contact with the potential
    target. Passive information gathering is usually fruitful, and a lot of organizations
    usually publish information and details about their organizations as a marketing
    strategy for their existing and potential customers. Sometimes, when organizations
    advertise a vacancy on a job recruiting website, the recruiter posts technical
    requirements for the potential candidate. From a penetration tester's point of
    view, the technical details can indicate the types of platforms and applications
    that are running within the organization's network infrastructure.

    unit within the AWS platform where the customer can add or remove files. In Microsoft

    hidden resources and files that weren't accessible via the online version. As
    a penetration tester, you can explore each offline directory thoroughly; normally,
    webmasters tend not to always perform any cleanup of old data and files, so there'll
    be lots to explore.

- en: As a user of the internet, you will have realized that multiple search engines
    such as MSN, Google, Yahoo, and Bing frequently learn and index new and existing
    websites to improve their search results. If you search for a company's website,
    you are most likely to discover the main domain name, such as `company.com`. A
    lot of organizations create subdomains for various reasons, however. As penetration
    testers, we would like to discover all the possible subdomains of a target organization
    as they can lead to login portals and sensitive corporate directories, which may
    contain confidential files and resources.

    tool. Sublist3r is a Python-based tool that is used to enumerate (extract/obtain)
    the subdomains of a given website using OSINT, such as search engines and other
    internet indexing platforms.

    prior to attacking a target. The information gathered during this phase is vital
    to the later phases of penetration testing. Information gathering helps create
    the foundation for the penetration tester's research of a target's security vulnerabilities,
    which is required for system and network exploitation.
