- en: Testing has always been part of software development. For decades, comprehensive
    testing was defined by complex manual test procedures backed by big budgets; but
    something revolutionary happened in 1998\. In his Guide to Better Smalltalk, Smalltalk
    guru, Kent Beck, introduced an automated test framework called SUnit. This triggered
    an avalanche of test frameworks, including JUnit, PyUnit, and many others for
    different languages and various platforms, dubbed the xUnit movement. Automated
    testing was made a cornerstone of the agile movement when the top 17 software
    experts signed the Agile Manifesto in 2001.

    testing, acceptance testing, smoke testing, load testing, and countless others.
    This book delves deeper and explores testing at all the important levels while
    using the nimble power of Python. It also demonstrates many tools.
