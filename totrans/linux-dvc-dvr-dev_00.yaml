- en: The Linux kernel is a complex, portable, modular, and widely used piece of software,
    running on around 80% of servers and embedded systems in more than half of the
    devices throughout the world. Device drivers play a critical role in the context
    of how well a Linux system performs. As Linux has turned out to be one of the
    most popular operating systems interest in developing personal device drivers
    is also increasing steadily.

- en: This book will begins with two chapters that will help you understand the basics
    of drivers and prepare you for the long journey through the Linux kernel. This
    book will then cover driver development based on Linux subsystems such as memory
    management, PWM, RTC, IIO, GPIO, IRQ management. The book will also cover practical
    approach to direct memory access and network device drivers.

    which is based on an ARM i.MX6 from NXP, with enough features and connections
    to allow us to cover all of tests discussed in the book. Some drivers are also
    provided for testing purposes for inexpensive components such as MCP23016 and
    24LC512, which are I2C GPIO controller and eeprom memory respectively.

    driver development and will be in a position to write any device driver from scratch
    using the latest kernel version (v4.13 at the time of writing).
