    and we've suggested once or twice before that the factor that differentiates an
    effective developer from an amateur isn't so much what they know as how they think.

    we saw in the last chapter, you can simplify a complicated problem by breaking
    it down and finding a starting point. Let's take a moment now to explore a few
    more tricks that can help.

- en: You may have heard this phrase before: **rubber-duck debugging**. It's been
    around a long while and it's one of the most effective problem-solving tricks
    you can perform. The idea here is simple. Take anybody who will listen, and if
    there's nobody around, a rubber duck on your desk would do just as well (hence
    the name). Describe the problem you're trying to solve, out loud, and in simple
    terms. This forces you to organize your thoughts about the problem. If you find
    that you can't describe the problem in clear, simple terms, then you don't understand
    it yet. You're not ready to try to answer the question because you're not yet
    clear on what question you need to ask. Play with it and explore it until you
    really can phrase it in simple terms. Often, this process alone will suggest a
    clear solution to you, and if not, you now have a much better shot at finding
    a solution because you now know what question you're asking. Do this out loud
    or in writing. It's too easy to stay fuzzy and gloss over things when you let
    it tumble around in your mind. Force yourself to put the words in order. You'll
    be surprised by how powerful and effective this technique is.

    you see happening. Not what you think you see happening—just what you see. It's
    far too easy in debugging to jump to a conclusion about why something is happening
    and then dive into trying to solve that problem before you've really ascertained
    what problem you actually have. Take a step back and just look at what you can
    concretely observe.

    opposed to *The spawning routine is putting things in the wrong place*. You don't
    know that yet. You just know that one torch isn't where you expected it to be.
    Do an experiment. Spawn a different object. Does it appear in the right place?
    OK, then maybe there's a weird offset in your model. Another object is also out
    of position? OK, then, yes, it might be the routine that's spawning it. Or it
    might be some collision in your level that's keeping things from spawning where
    you want them and is shoving them to the closest available spot. Try moving the
    spawn point and see whether that changes things.

    we're solving. What do we see? What can we think of that might be causing that?
    How could we test it to see whether we're right? What new information did our
    test just give us? Do we know enough to work on a solution now?

    the wrong problem. Taking the time to take a step back will help to keep you from
    doing this and keep you from a lot of frustrated stabbing in the dark. You'll
    solve problems this way.

    in positive terms: *We needed to make sure the player can''t fire their weapon
    while the pause menu is up. This takes care of it by having the input handler
    check for a paused state before it calls the fire function.* Finally, you should

    your game online, and the thing you did shows up incorrectly on the client, and
    you realize to your horror that you have to rewrite every one of those systems
    you built on top of that hack that went in for the demo, and, even worse, you

    what the proper solution should really be, write it into a comment right next
    to the hack. And then fix it before you build anything else on top of it. If you've
    gotten a blueprint or a bit of code running, go straight into your *make it right* phase

    Are there examples in the templates or the sample projects that show how it can
    be solved? Has someone written a tutorial somewhere? Sometimes, the answer is
    going to be *no*, but far more often, you're going to find something that either
    points you directly toward a solution or gets you closer than you would have gotten
