- en: RESTful services have become the de facto standard data feed providers for social
    services, news feeds, and mobile devices. They deliver a large amount of data
    to millions of users. Thus, they need to address high-availability requirements,
    such as reliability and scalability. This book will show you how to utilize the
    Node.js platform to implement a robust and performant data service. By the end
    of this book, you will have learned how to implement a real-life RESTful service,
    taking advantage of the modern NoSQL database to serve both JSON and binary content.

    also covered, with detailed examples, showing you everything you need to know
    to start implementing the robust RESTful APIs that serve content to your applications.

- en: This book targets developers who want to enrich their development skills by
    learning how to develop scalable, server-side, RESTful applications based on the
    Node.js platform. You also need to be aware of HTTP communication concepts and
    should have a working knowledge of the JavaScript language. Keep in mind that
    this is not a book that will teach you how to program in JavaScript. Knowledge
    of REST will be an added advantage but is definitely not a necessity.
