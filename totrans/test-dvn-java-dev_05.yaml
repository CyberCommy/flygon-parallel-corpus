- en: In software development, whether you are an expert or a beginner, there are
    some situations where code seems to be unnatural. You can't avoid the feeling
    that something is wrong with that code when reading it. Occasionally, you even
    wonder why the previous programmer implemented a specific method or a class in
    such a twisted manner. This is because the same functionality can be implemented
    in a vast number of different ways, each of them unique. With this huge number
    of possibilities, which is the best one? What defines a good solution? Why is
    one better than the others? The fact is, all of them are valid so long as the
    goal is achieved. However, it is true that some aspects should be considered when
    choosing the right solution. This is where the design of the solution becomes
    relevant.

- en: Most senior developers and experienced programmers know about software design
    principles and it's very likely that, independently of whether they practice TDD,
    they are applying them to their daily work. The TDD philosophy encourages programmers—even
    beginners—to follow some principles and good practices that make code cleaner
    and more readable. Those practices are enforced by the Red-Green-Refactor cycle.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Red-Green-Refactor cycle advocates for small feature increments by introducing
    one test that fails at a time. Programmers add code fragments, as concise and
    short as possible, so neither the new test or the old ones do not fail anymore.
    And ultimately, they refactor the code, which consists of cleanup and improvement
    tasks such as duplication removal or code optimization.

    but demonstrates that the code behaves the way it has been programmed, which is
    not necessarily the way code is expected to behave. Also, focusing on code coverage
    leads to bad tests that turn our production code into immutable entities. Every
    modification we may want to add may cause several tests from different, unrelated
    parts of the code to fail. That fact means the cost of introducing changes becomes

- en: 'Using TDD, we got a class with a constructor, five public methods, and six
    private methods. In general, all methods look pretty simple and easy to understand.
    In this approach, we also got a big method to check winner conditions: `checkWinner`.
    The advantage is that with this approach we got a bunch of useful tests to guarantee
    that future modifications do not alter the behavior of the method accidentally,
    allowing for the introduction of new changes painlessly. Code coverage wasn''t
    the goal, but we got a really high percentage.'

- en: Additionally, for testing purposes, we refactored the constructor of the class
    to accept the output channel as a parameter (**dependency injection**). If we
    need to modify the way the game status is printed, it will be easier that way
    than replacing all the uses in the traditional approach. Hence, it is more extensible.
    In the test-last approach, we have been abusing the `System.println` method and
    it will be really tedious task if we decide to change all the occurrences for
    any other thing.

    for a single class, this enables you to split the class following the Single Responsibility
    Principle. As the output printing was delegated to an external class passed in
    a parameter in initialization, a more elegant solution would be to create a class
    with high-level printing methods. That would keep the printing logic separated
    from the game logic. Like the huge code coverage shown in the following image,
    these are a few examples of the benefits of good design using TDD:'

    both approaches, but TDD is a better approach.
