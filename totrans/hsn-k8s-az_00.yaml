- en: Kubernetes is the leading standard in container orchestration, used by start-ups
    and large enterprises alike. Microsoft is one of the largest contributors to the
    open source project, and it offers a managed service to run Kubernetes clusters
    at scale.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book will walk you through what it takes to build and run applications
    on top of the **Azure Kubernetes Service** (**AKS**). It starts with an explanation
    of the fundamentals of Docker and Kubernetes, after which you will build a cluster
    and start deploying multiple applications. With the help of real-world examples,
    you'll learn how to deploy applications on top of AKS, implement authentication,
    monitor your applications, and integrate AKS with other Azure services such as
    databases, Event Hubs, and Functions.
