    tasks in Navicat, but not everything it has to offer. This appendix aims at giving
    you some additional tips and tricks about using some of the not-so-obvious features
    of Navicat, such as:'

- en: In cases where you work with more than one computer (where each computer has
    a copy of Navicat), you might want to have your settings, connection profiles,
    custom queries, data model diagrams, and even batch jobs copied across all the
    computers you use. Even if this is not the case, you can use the tips here to
    back up your Navicat settings for restoring the data later, in the event of resetting
    up your computer.

- en: All of your settings, connection profiles, saved queries, and models in Navicat
    are stored in two folders on the Mac, which reside in `/Users/<user_name>/Library/Application
    Support/`. You can customize the **Data Models Path** from the **Preferences**
    window (simply select **Preferences...** from the application menu next to the
    **Apple** menu, and go to the **File Paths** tab in the opening window). One of
    the folders under `Application Support` is named `PremiumSoft CyberTech`, and
    the other is `Navicat Premium` or `Navicat for MySQL`, depending on the edition
    and version you're using.

    the **+** and **G** keys simultaneously) and type `/Users/<user_name>/Library/Application`
    `Support/`, and then press the **Go** button to get there. And finally, copy these
    two folders to the same folder hierarchy on the target machine or the user.

- en: Certain user data, such as queries and data model diagrams, as well as reports
    (exclusive to the Windows version) of Navicat are stored inside the `Navicat`
    directory, by default, in the user's `Documents` folder. Other settings and connection
    profiles are stored in the registry in the Windows version.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You can export the connection settings by going through **File** | **Export
    Connections...** in Navicat's main menu bar, or right-clicking on a connection
    definition (database server name) from the left pane and selecting the same menu
    item. Then on the target system (or the user account) you can repeat the same
    steps, except choosing **Import Connections...** this time and specifying the
    previously exported file (and its path) through an **open file** dialog box.

    something like `C:\Users\<user_name>\Documents\Navicat`.

- en: 'You can transfer the queries and data model diagrams to another Windows PC
    by simply copying the entire `Navicat` folder to the target user''s `Documents`
    folder. Make sure Navicat is not running on the target machine while you perform
    this transfer. Refer to the following screenshot:'

- en: With Navicat, you can monitor your database server(s) to view the running processes,
    the server's current status, as well as the properties of the databases, such
    as the variables. It is possible to get this information in real time for all
    of your servers, in a single, under-the-hood view.

    main menu bar, and it has three main views categorized by tabs in the Windows
    version and main toolbar buttons in the Mac version. Refer to the following screenshot:'

    an option of refreshing the view automatically or manually. One not-so-obvious
    trick is that in the case of auto-refreshing, you can change the interval of the
    **1** second default to whatever you prefer, by choosing **Set Refresh Rate...**
    from the **Edit** menu.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Under this tab, you can get all the server variables, such as **character_set_server**
    and **date_format**, and the values set for these variables listed in alphabetical
    order. This information is normally gotten by executing the **SHOW VARIABLES**
    command in the MySQL server console.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    clicking the square-shaped button at the right end of the cell containing the
    variable value. (A feature for advanced users who really know what they're doing.)

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You can use Navicat to locate one or more database table records matching a
    certain criteria. After you select a database or schema from the left-hand side
    pane of Navicat's main window and right-click on it, you will see the **Find in
    database...** command among the items of the opening pop-up menu. Issuing this
    command will reveal a pop-up window that will let you enter a search string and
    matching criteria (such as **Exact** or **Contains**, or even evaluate a **Regular
    Expression**).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For example, select **our_first_db** that we created in [Chapter 2](ch02.html
    "Chapter 2. Working with Databases"), *Working with Databases*, and right-click
    on it and choose **Find in database...**. Then, enter `manager` in the search
    box, leave the matching criterion as **Contains**, and click on the **Find** button.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'The search should yield 12 matches and the results should be summarized below
    the search box. What''s cool about this feature is that, when you double-click
    on one of the results, a new query window will open up with a generated SQL query
    that was translated from our search criteria, which is automatically executed
    once, with the results displayed below it. Refer to the following screenshot:'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This appendix provided us with some additional tips and tricks, such as how
    to backup or transfer our Navicat settings. What's more? We have unraveled some
    more hidden features of Navicat (such as the **Server Monitor)**, which not only
    give us detailed information about running processes, such as the client user
    information and command type run by the connected user, but full control to manually
    terminate processes as well. We also saw how to get other detailed information,
    such as server variables and server statuses, using this powerful tool.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Lastly, we have seen a search feature that enables us to retrieve specific records
    from any table containing the searched string and automatically generates a SQL
    query, which can be reused to perform the same search later as a standard Navicat
    query.
