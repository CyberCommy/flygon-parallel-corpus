- en: Most businesses today are driven by their IT infrastructure, and the tiniest
    crack in this IT network can bring down the entire business. Metasploit is a pentesting
    network that can validate your system by performing elaborate penetration tests
    using the Metasploit Framework to secure your infrastructure.

- en: This Learning Path introduces you to the basic functionalities and applications
    of Metasploit. Throughout this book, you’ll learn different techniques for programming
    Metasploit modules to validate services such as databases, fingerprinting, and
    scanning. You’ll get to grips with post exploitation and write quick scripts to
    gather information from exploited systems. As you progress, you’ll delve into
    real-world scenarios where performing penetration tests are a challenge. With
    the help of these case studies, you’ll explore client-side attacks using Metasploit
    and a variety of scripts built on the Metasploit Framework.
