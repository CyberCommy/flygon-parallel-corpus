- en: Using the same framework to build both server and client-side applications saves
    you time and money. This book teaches you how you can use JavaScript and Node.js
    to build highly scalable APIs that work well with lightweight cross-platform client
    applications. It begins with the basics of Node.js in the context of backend development,
    and quickly leads you through the creation of an example client that pairs up
    with a fully authenticated API implementation.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book is ideal for developers who already understand JavaScript and are
    looking for a quick no-frills introduction to API development with Node.js. Though
    prior experience with other server-side technologies such as Python, PHP, ASP.NET,
    Ruby will help, it's not essential to have a background in backend development
    before getting started.
