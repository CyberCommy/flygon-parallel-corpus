- en: Flask is a web framework for Python that is specifically designed to provide
    the minimum amount of functionality that is needed to create web apps. Unlike
    other web frameworks, especially those in other languages, Flask does not have
    an entire ecosystem of libraries bundled with it for things such as database querying
    or form handling. Flask instead prefers to be an implementation agnostic.

- en: The main feature of this setup is that it allows the programmer to design their
    app and their tools in any way they want. Not providing their own version of common
    abstractions also means that the standard library can be used much more often
    than other frameworks, which guarantees their stability and readability by other
    Python programmers. Because the Flask community is rather large, there are also
    many different community-provided ways of adding common functionality. One of
    the main focuses of this book is to introduce these extensions and find out how
    they can help avoid reinventing the wheel. The best part about these extensions
    is that if you don't need their extra functionality, you don't need to include
    them and your app will stay small.

- en: The main downside of this setup is that the vast majority of new Flask users
    do not know how to properly structure large applications and end up creating an
    unintelligible and unmaintainable mess of code. This is why the other main focus
    of this book is how to create a Model View Controller (MVC) architecture with
    Flask apps.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Originally invented to design desktop user interfaces, the MVC setup allows
    the data handling (models), user interaction (controllers), and user interface
    (views) to be separated into three different components.

- en: Separating these three different components allows the programmer to reuse code
    rather than re-implement the same functionality for each web page. For example,
    if the data handling code wasn't split into its own separate functions, we would
    have to write the same database connection code and SQL queries in each of the
    functions that render a web page.

- en: A large amount of research and a lot of painful first-hand experience of what
    can go wrong while developing web applications has made this book the most comprehensive
    resource on Flask available, so I sincerely hope that you will enjoy reading it.
