- en: As a user, I'll bet the answer is likely to be quite a few; this includes smart
    TVs, cell phones, and the like. As developers, it is up to us to provide a user
    experience that works on multiple devices. Welcome to the world of responsive
    design!

- en: Responsive design is not only all about creating a great user experience, but
    one that works well on multiple different devices, from a simple online ordering
    process for tickets, right through to an extensive e-commerce system. Many of
    the tips you see throughout the course of this book don't require extensive changes
    to your existing development methodology. In many cases, it's enough to make some
    simple changes to begin building responsive sites.

    Media*, walks us through how to make our media responsive. We cover some of the
    tips and tricks available for use and examine why, in some cases, it is preferable

    Queries*, leads us to explore media queries and how we can use them to control
    what content is displayed at particular screen width settings. We cover the basics
    of creating breakpoints and examine why these should be based around where content
    breaks in our design and not simply for specific devices we want to support.'

    *Testing and Optimizing for Performance*, rounds off our journey through the essentials
    of responsive web design with a look at how we can test and optimize our code
    for efficiency. We explore some of the reasons why pages load slowly, how we can
    measure our performance, and understand why even though the same tricks can be
    applied to any site. It''s even more critical that we incorporate them when designing
    responsively.'
