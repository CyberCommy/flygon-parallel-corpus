- en: Penetration testing can be a complex topic, especially if you are someone who
    is just starting out in the field. When I wrote this book, I looked at my own
    situation and how overwhelmed I felt when I started working in penetration testing.
    There is a lot of great content available online, but knowing where to start was
    the point that I really got stuck on. I would find content that assumes you have
    some knowledge of penetration testing, or knowledge of how a certain tool works,
    and so on.

- en: This book is geared to those who are looking at finding a good starting point
    on their career within penetration testing. The objective of the book is not to
    teach you flashy skills that you can use to break into networks, but rather to
    help you gain a good understanding of the technology while practicing your skills
    in a controlled environment using real-world tools.

- en: The goal of the book is to give you a good, solid understanding of penetration
    testing by the time you've finished reading. You will be able to fully grasp the
    phases of a penetration test, how to perform various techniques, and how to use
    various tools.

- en: This book is intended for those who wish to learn about penetration testing,
    but whoÂ only have minimal or no experience with this particular topic. The ideal
    person to read this book either has some basic IT education and knows the basics
    of Linux, or is self-taught and able to pick up new skills fast, through both
    theory and hands-on practice. Those who already have some skills in ethical hacking
    may find it easier to digest the contents of this book on a faster-than-average
    basis.

    Testing*, helps you to understand what a penetration test is. Here, we will introduce
    the stages of a penetration test and what happens at each stage. Having a lab
    is key for learning, so we will cover how to build your own lab environment using
    VMware, Hyper-V, or VirtualBox. We will discuss target virtual machines based
    on Windows and Linux, which you will use to practice your skills.'

    Kali Linux*, gets you started with a penetration base operating system. Kali Linux
    is well known and used by both pentesters and attackers. We will cover the installation
    and setup of Kali Linux, as well as the basic commands and essential tools that
    are contained within Kali Linux. We will look at installing additional tools,
    maintaining updates of the tools, and how to leverage scripts within Kali Linux.'

- en: In order to gain the most benefit from the practical aspects of this book, you
    will need to have a virtualization environment set up. This can be set up using
    VMware or VirtualBox. Hyper-V will work, but there is a restriction that does
    not allow you to link a wireless card directly to the virtual machine. This prevents
    you from performing wireless attacks if you have a compatible wireless card.

- en: The penetration testing operating system of choice is Kali Linux. Having some
    basic Linux knowledge is not mandatory, but would be beneficial. Kali Linux contains
    hundreds of tools. We do not focus on all of them, but only on the tools that
    would get the job done. Occasionally, we will look at tools that are available
    on the internet, but the installation and setup steps are clearly defined within
    the book.

    as Metasploitable and OWASP BWA. We will work with Windows Server and Windows
    10 as a target operating system in some chapters; the evaluation editions of these
    operating systems will suffice. Having knowledge of how to set up Active Directory
    would be beneficial.

    focusing on teaching you how to use various techniques, methodologies, and tools
    to obtain the results you need. Your knowledge will increase over time as you
    continue to apply what you have learned and gain experience by practicing your
    skills with various other vulnerable machines found on the internet.
