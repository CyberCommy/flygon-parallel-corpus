    to receive and send messages. We will comprehend it in several steps. First, we
    will explain the mechanism that lies beneath and how to use Android broadcast
    messages. Then, we will listen for some of the most common messages. Since it's
    not enough just to listen, we will create new ones and broadcast them. Finally,
    we will meet with boot, shutdown, and network broadcast messages, so our application
    is aware of this important system event.

- en: Android applications can send or receive messages. Messages can be system-related
    events or custom ones defined by us. Interested parties are registered for certain
    messages by defining a proper intent filter and broadcast receiver. When a message
    is broadcast, all interested parties are notified. It is important to note that
    once you subscribe for broadcast messages (especially from the `Activity` class),
    you must unsubscribe at some point. When can we use broadcast messages? We use
    broadcast messages when we need a messaging system across our application. For
    example, imagine you started a long running process in the background. At some
    point, you want to notify multiple contexts about processing results. Broadcast
    messages are a perfect solution for this.

    system events happen. Every message we send and finally receive is wrapped in
    the `Intent` class containing information about that particular event. Each `Intent`
    must have a proper action set. For example--`android.intent.action.ACTION_POWER_CONNECTED`.
    Information about the event is represented with bundled extra data. For example,
    we may have bundled an extra string field representing particular data related
    to the event we are interested in. Let''s consider an example of charging and
    battery information. Each time the battery status changes, interested parties
    will be notified and receive a broadcast message with information about the battery
    level:'

    have a receiver leaking! Similarly, if we register in `onResume()` of our activity,
    we must unregister in `onPause()`. If we do not do this, we will register multiple

    it do? The method returns an object of the `PendingResult` type, which represents
    a pending result from calling an `API` method. The Android system considers the
    receiver alive until we call the `finish()` method on this instance. Using this
    mechanism, it's possible to do asynchronous processing in a broadcast receiver.
    After we finish our intensive work, we call `finish()` to indicate to the Android
    system that this component can be recycled.

    receiver at a time. Since receivers execute in order, it's possible to propagate
    a result to the next receiver. Also, it's possible to abort the broadcast so that
    it won't be passed to the rest of the receivers. We can control the order in which
    receivers are executed. We can use the `android:priority` attribute of the matching
    intent filter to prioritize.
