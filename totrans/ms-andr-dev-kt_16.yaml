    First of all, remove any unused resources or classes. Then, mute your logging!
    It's good practice to use some of the mainstream logging library. You can a create
    a wrapper around the `Log` class and, for each log output to have a condition,
    check that it must not be the `release` build type.

    For the obfuscation, we will use ProGuard. ProGuard is a free Java class file

    classes, fields, methods, and attributes. It optimizes bytecode as well!

    to remove all the unused code. However, it can happen for ProGuard to remove the
    code your app actually needs! For that purpose, you must define the ProGuard configuration
    to keep those classes. Open your project''s ProGuard configuration file and append

    and started with learning the basics. Then, we continued toward the medium, difficult,
    and advanced topics about Android. This chapter allowed us the final word on the
    story about Android we wanted to tell you. We did a huge amount of work! We developed
    the application and went through the whole process of deployment, step by step.

- en: What is next? Well, the next thing you should do is think about an application
    you want to build and start making it from scratch. Take your time. Don't rush
    yourself! During the development, you will discover many things we did not mention.
    Android is tremendously big! It can take years to know the entire framework. Many
    developers don't know every part of it. You will not be the only one. Continue
    your progress and do as much code as you can. It will improve your skills and
    make all that you learned routine to you. Do not hesitate! Get into the action!
    Good luck!
