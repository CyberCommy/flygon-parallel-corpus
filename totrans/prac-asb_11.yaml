- en: In this section, we will take a practically based look at how to get the most
    out of Ansible in an enterprise environment. We will start by looking at how to
    automate your network devices with Ansible, before moving onto the use of Ansible
    to manage both cloud and container environments. We will then look at some of
    the more advanced testing and troubleshooting strategies that will assist you
    in your use of Ansible in an enterprise, before finally looking at the Ansible
    Tower/AWX product, which provides rich **Role-Based Access Control** (**RBAC**)
    and auditing capabilities in enterprise settings.
