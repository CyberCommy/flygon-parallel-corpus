- en: Plotting addresses or points of interest on a map is one of the most commonly
    used functions in web mapping applications. To plot an address as a point on a
    map, you'll first need to get the latitude and longitude coordinates. Geocoding
    is the process of converting physical addresses into geographic coordinates. In
    order for your addresses to be added to the map, they must go through a geocoding
    process that assigns coordinates to the address. Geocoding is accomplished in
    ArcGIS Server through the use of a Locator service and is executed through the
    ArcGIS Server JavaScript API with the `Locator` class, which accesses these services
    to provide address-matching capabilities as well as reverse geocoding. As with
    the other tasks provided by ArcGIS Server, geocoding requires various input parameters,
    including an `Address` object to match addresses or a `Point` object in the case
    of reverse geocoding. This information is then submitted to the geocoding service
    and an `AddressCandidate` object containing the address matches is returned and
    can then be plotted on the map.

    the process. If you have an address located at 150 Main St, you must first geocode
    the address before it can be plotted as a point on a map. If 150 Main St lies
    on a street segment with an address range of 100 to 200 Main St, the geocoding
    process would interpolate the location of 150 Main St. to be exactly halfway along
    this street segment. The geocoding software would then assign 150 Main St. to
    the geographic location that corresponds to the halfway point between 100 and
    200 Main St. Now that you have the coordinates for the address, you can plot it
    on the map. This process is described in the following diagram:'

- en: The most common geocoding level is the street segment geocode, which assigns
    latitude/longitude coordinates based on known geocodes at the intersection of
    the block or street segment containing an address. This method of geocoding uses
    an interpolation process as described earlier. This method is the most accurate
    in urban areas with regularly spaced addresses. However, it does have problems
    accurately geocoding irregularly spaced addresses and addresses located in a cul
    de sac. The coordinates of rural areas are also notoriously less complete and
    this results in lower geocoding rates in those areas.

    Using the ArcGIS Server API for JavaScript, you can submit an address to the `Locator`
    service and retrieve geographic coordinates for the address, which can then be
    plotted on the map. The following figure illustrates this process. An address,
    defined by a JSON object in JavaScript, is an input to a `Locator` object, which
    geocodes the address and returns the results in an `AddressCandidate` object,
    which can then be displayed as a point on your map. This pattern is the same as
    the other tasks we saw in previous chapters, where an input object (the `Address`
    object) provides input parameters to the task (`Locator`), which submits the job
    to ArcGIS Server. A result object (`AddressCandidate`) is then returned to a callback
    function, which processes the returned data.

    `JSON` object that represents an address. The JSON object defines an address that
    is formatted in the form of an object, as seen in the following code example.
    The address is defined as a series of name/value pairs defined within brackets,
    which are defined within your JavaScript code. Individual name/value pairs are
    defined for the street, city, state, and zip code in this case, but the name/value
    pairs will vary depending upon the type of geocoding service you've defined in
    your locator.

    a `Map.click` event, which can be retrieved and used as the input object to the
    `Locator` service.

    method to perform a reverse geocode. These methods result in an event that is
    fired at the completion of the operation. In the case of an address geocode, the
    `address-to-locations-complete()` event fires, and the `on-location-to-address-complete()`
    event fires on the completion of a reverse geocode operation. In either case,
    an `AddressCandidate` object is then returned to the event.

    Various properties are stored in this object, including the address, attributes,
    location, and score. The attributes property contains name/value pairs of field
    names and values. The location is, as the name would suggest, the x and y coordinate
    of the candidate address. The score property is a numeric value between 0 and
    100 that indicates the quality of the address returned with a higher score, representing
    a better match. Multiple addresses can be stored in this object as an array of
    candidates.

- en: Now, we're going to take a closer look at the Locator methods used to submit
    addresses and points. The `Locator.addressToLocations()` method sends a request
    to geocode a single address. An input address object is created and used as a
    parameter in the `addressToLocations()` method found on a `Locator` object. The
    results of the geocoding operation are returned in an `AddressCandidate` object.
    The address can then be plotted on the map as a graphic.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Reverse geocoding can also be performed by a `Locator` object through the `locationToAddress()`
    method. A `Point` object, created either by an end user click on the map or through
    application logic, is created and passed as a parameter into the `locationToAddress()`
    method. A second parameter is also passed into the method, indicating a distance
    in meters from the point where a matching address should be found. As with the
    `addressToLocations()` method, an `AddressCandidate` object is returned from the
    locator and contains an address, if one was found.
