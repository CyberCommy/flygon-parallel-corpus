- en: A few years ago, if you would have said "gamification" to someone, you would
    have gotten a weird look, as though you were concocting something new. Maybe you
    would have gotten a quick follow up question, "Huh? What is that?"
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Today, that encounter would be very different. Although very misunderstood,
    businesses are taking gamification very seriously, as they find it more and more
    difficult to engage and ultimately retain customers.

- en: In this book, we take a closer look at gamification. We assume you know nothing
    about gamification but have some background in website development. We walk you
    through the Gamification Design Framework outlined in this book, applying gamification
    principles along the way.

    is focused on user engagement and fun to develop systems.
