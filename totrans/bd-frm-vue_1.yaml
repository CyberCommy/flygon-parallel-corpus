    CLI is an amazing tool to quickly scaffold Vue applications. Vue CLI was born
    to be the go-to tool for scaffolding applications. Even though there are other
    amazing solutions, such as Nuxt, knowing the basics of Vue CLI will get you going
    with most projects. If you haven''t used it before, don''t worry: we will dive
    into the setup step by step together.'

    on your development computer first.
