    it is rarely necessary to post a question because there is almost always somebody

    Studio version has a bug or a new version of the Android API seems to not be doing
    what it should, then you can be almost certain that a few thousand other developers
    around the world are having the same problem as you. Then, some smart coder, often
    from the Android development team itself, will be there with an answer.
