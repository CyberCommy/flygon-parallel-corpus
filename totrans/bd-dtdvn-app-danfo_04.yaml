    for machines to consume was well pioneered by Donald Knuth, who also wrote a book
    about it called *Literate Programming* ([https://www.amazon.com/Literate-Programming-byKnuth-Knuth/dp/B004WKFC4S](https://www.amazon.com/Literate-Programming-byKnuth-Knuth/dp/B004WKFC4S)).
    Tools such as Jupyter Notebook give equal weight to prose and code, hence programmers
    and researchers are free to express themselves extensively through code and text
    (including images and workflows).

- en: Over the past few years in the field of data science, interactive computing
    environments such as Jupyter Notebook and JupyterLab have actually made a huge
    impact in terms of how code is shared, and this has enhanced fast and rapid iterations
    of ideas.

    support diverse users such as web developers. This means that a lot of mature
    data science tooling available in the Python ecosystem needed to be ported or
    made available in JavaScript as well. Following this line of reasoning, we, the
    authors of this book, as well as the creators of Danfo.js, decided to create a
    new version of the Jupyter Notebook specifically targeted at the JavaScript ecosystem.

    JavaScript, and as such, Dnotebook has an inbuilt function called `load_package`
    for doing this.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    to your notebook via their CDN links. For instance, to load `Tensorflow.js` and
    `Plotly.js`, you can pass their CDN links to the `load_package` function, as shown
    in the following code:'

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    `Danfo.js` DataFrame asynchronously. You should use this instead of Danfo's built-in
    `read_csv` function when reading big files and you want to track the progress.
    This is because `load_csv` displays a spinner on the navbar to indicate the progress.
