- en: The TypeScript language and compiler has been a huge success story since its
    release in late 2012\. It has quickly carved out a solid footprint in the JavaScript
    development community, and continues to go from strength to strength. Many large-scale
    JavaScript projects, including projects by Adobe, Mozilla, and Asana, have made
    the decision to switch their code base from JavaScript to TypeScript. Recently,
    the Microsoft and Google teams announced that Angular 2.0 will be developed with
    TypeScript, thereby merging the AtScript and TypeScript languages into one.

- en: This large-scale industry adoption of TypeScript shows the value of the language,
    the flexibility of the compiler, and the productivity gains that can be realized
    with its rich development toolset. On top of this industry support, the ECMAScript
    6 standard is getting closer and closer to publication, and TypeScript provides
    a way to use features of this standard in our applications today.

- en: Writing JavaScript single page applications in TypeScript has been made even
    more appealing with the large collection of declaration files that have been built
    by the TypeScript community. These declaration files seamlessly integrate a large
    range of existing JavaScript frameworks into the TypeScript development environment,
    bringing with it increased productivity, early error detection, and advanced IntelliSense
    features.

    and Using Declaration Files*, walks the reader through building a declaration
    file for an existing body of JavaScript code, and then lists some of the most
    common syntax used when writing declaration files. This syntax is designed to
    be a quick reference guide to declaration file syntax, or a cheat sheet.'

    shows the reader how to use declaration files from the DefinitelyTyped repository
    within the development environment. It then moves on to show the reader how to
    write TypeScript that is compatible with three popular JavaScript frameworks—Backbone,
    Angular, and ExtJs.'

    starts with a discussion on what Test Driven Development is, and then guides the
    reader through the process of creating various types of unit tests using the Jasmine
    library, including data-driven and asynchronous tests. The chapter finishes with

    at the two types of module generation that the TypeScript compiler uses: CommonJS
    and AMD. This chapter shows the reader how to build a CommonJS module for use
    with Node, and then discusses building AMD modules with Require, Backbone, AMD
    plugins, and jQuery plugins.'

    using an HTML-only version of the application. It then moves on to discuss, build
    and test the underlying data models and Marionette views that will be used within
    the application. Finally, the State and Mediator Design Pattern is implemented
    to manage page transitions and graphical elements.'

    compiler is available as a Node.js plugin or a Windows executable; therefore,
    it will run on any operating system. [Chapter 1](ch01.html "Chapter 1. TypeScript
    – Tools and Framework Options"), *TypeScript – Tools and Framework Options* describes
    the setup of a development environment.
