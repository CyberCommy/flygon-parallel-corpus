    which complies with multiple programming languages. For a long time it has been
    the editor of choice to major developer communities. Along with the growing market
    demand, NetBeans has integrated the PHP development features since NetBeans 6.5
    (November 2008), and these days, it has become one of the most popular IDEs for
    the PHP community.
