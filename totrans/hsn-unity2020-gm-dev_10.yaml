    should be heard, and the sources of most of them will be outside the room, such
    as an aeroplane flying overhead, a construction site two blocks away, and cars
    in the street. Creating objects that won''t be seen is a waste of resources. Instead,
    we can place individual sounds all over the scene to recreate the desired ambience,
    but that would be resource-intensive, requiring lots of CPU and RAM to achieve
    believable results. Considering that these sounds usually are in the second plane
    of the user''s attention, we can just combine them all into a single looping track
    and just play one audio, and that''s exactly what ambient sound is. If you want
    to create a café scene, you can simply go to a real café and record a few minutes
    of audio, using that as your ambient sound.'

- en: Let's discuss the most important ones, starting with **Force To Mono**. Some
    audio may come with stereo channels, meaning that we have one sound for the left
    ear and another one for the right ear. This means that one piece of audio can
    actually contain two different audio tracks. Stereo sound is useful for different
    effects and instrument spatialization in the case of music, so we want that in
    those scenarios, but there are other scenarios where stereo is not useful. Consider
    3D sound effects such as a shooting gun or some walking-pace steps. In those cases,
    we need the sound to be heard in the direction to the source. If the shooting
    of a gun happened to my left, I need to hear it coming from my left. In these
    cases, we can convert stereo audio to mono audio by checking the **Force To Mono**
    checkbox in the audio import settings. This will make Unity combine the two channels
    into a single one, reducing the size of the audio usually to almost half its size
    (sometimes more, sometimes less, depending on various aspects).
  id: totrans-30
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 让我们讨论最重要的几个，首先是**强制转换为单声道**。一些音频可能带有立体声声道，这意味着我们左耳和右耳分别有一个声音。这意味着一段音频实际上可以包含两个不同的音轨。立体声音对于不同的效果和乐器空间化在音乐的情况下是有用的，所以在这些情况下我们希望有这种效果，但也有其他情况下立体声并不有用。考虑3D音效，比如射击枪声或步行声音。在这些情况下，我们需要听到声音来自源头的方向。如果枪声发生在我的左边，我需要听到它来自我的左边。在这些情况下，我们可以通过在音频导入设置中勾选**强制转换为单声道**复选框来将立体声音转换为单声道音频。这将使Unity将两个声道合并为一个声道，将音频的大小通常减少到几乎一半（有时更多，有时更少，这取决于各种因素）。

    In order to play some audio, Unity needs to read the audio from disk, decompress,
    and then play it. Load Type changes the way those three processes are handled.
    We have the following three options here:'
  id: totrans-35
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 接下来要讨论的设置是**加载类型**，这是一个重要的设置。为了播放一些音频，Unity需要从磁盘读取音频，解压缩，然后播放。加载类型改变了这三个过程的处理方式。我们在这里有以下三个选项：
- en: '**Decompress on Load**: The most memory-intensive option. This mode will make
    Unity load the audio uncompressed in memory when the scene is loaded. That means
    that the audio will take lots of space in RAM because we have the uncompressed
    version loaded. The advantage of using this mode is that playing the audio is
    easier because we have the raw audio data ready to play in RAM.'
  id: totrans-36
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: '**加载时解压缩**：最占用内存的选项。这种模式将使Unity在场景加载时将音频解压缩到内存中。这意味着音频将占用大量RAM空间，因为我们已经加载了未压缩的版本。使用这种模式的优势在于播放音频更容易，因为我们已经准备好在RAM中播放原始音频数据。'
- en: '**Streaming**: The total opposite of **Decompress on Load**. This mode never
    loads audio in RAM. Instead, while the audio is playing, Unity reads a piece of
    the audio asset from disk, decompresses it, plays it, and repeats, running this
    process once for each piece of audio playing in **Streaming**. This means that
    this mode will be CPU - intensive, but will consume almost zero bytes of RAM.'
  id: totrans-37
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: '**流式传输**：与**加载时解压缩**完全相反。这种模式从不在RAM中加载音频。相反，当音频播放时，Unity会从磁盘读取音频资产的一部分，解压缩它，播放它，然后重复这个过程，对于每个正在**流式传输**播放的音频部分运行一次。这意味着这种模式将会占用大量CPU资源，但几乎不会消耗RAM字节。'
- en: '**Compressed in Memory**: The middle ground. This mode will load the audio
    from disk when the scene is loaded but will keep it compressed in memory. When
    Unity needs to play the audio, it will just take a piece from RAM, decompress
    it, and play it. Remember that reading pieces of the audio asset from RAM is considerably
    faster than reading from disk.'
  id: totrans-38
  prefs:

  zh: '**内存中的压缩**：中间地带。这种模式将在场景加载时从磁盘加载音频，但将保持其在内存中的压缩状态。当Unity需要播放音频时，它只会从RAM中取一部分，解压缩并播放。请记住，从RAM中读取音频资产的部分比从磁盘读取要快得多。'
- en: 'Maybe if you are an experienced developer you can easily determine which mode
    is better suited for which kind of audio, but if this is your first encounter
    with video games, it may sound confusing, so let''s discuss the best modes for
    different cases:'
  id: totrans-39

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 也许如果您是一位经验丰富的开发者，您可以轻松确定哪种模式更适合哪种类型的音频，但如果这是您第一次接触视频游戏，可能会感到困惑，所以让我们讨论不同情况下的最佳模式：
- en: '**Frequent short audio**: This could be a shooting gun or the sound of footsteps,
    which are sounds that last less than 1 second but can occur in several instances
    and play at the same time. In such cases, we can use Decompress On Load. Uncompressed
    short audio won''t have a huge size difference from its compressed version. Also,
    since this is the most performant CPU option, having several instances won''t
    have a huge impact on performance.'
  id: totrans-40
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: '**频繁的短音频**：这可能是射击枪声或脚步声等持续时间不到1秒的声音，但可能会在多个实例中发生并同时播放。在这种情况下，我们可以使用加载时解压缩。未压缩的短音频与其压缩版本的大小差异不大。而且，由于这是性能最佳的CPU选项，有多个实例不会对性能产生巨大影响。'
- en: '**Infrequent large audio**: This includes music, ambient sound, and dialog.
    These kinds of audio usually have just one instance playing, and they are usually
    big. Those cases are better suited for Streaming mode because having them compressed
    or decompressed in RAM can have a huge impact in low-end devices such as mobile
    devices (on PCs, we can use Compressed in Memory sometimes). A CPU can handle
    having two or three bits of audio playing in Streaming, but try to have no more
    than that.'
  id: totrans-41
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Frequent medium audio**: This includes pre-made voice chat dialog in multiplayer
    games, character emotes, long explosions, or any audio that is more than 500 KB
    (that is not a strict rule – this number depends a lot on the target device).
    Having this kind of audio decompressed in RAM can have a noticeable impact on
    performance, but due to the fact that this audio is fairly frequently used, we
    can have it compressed in memory. Their relatively smaller size means they usually
    won''t make a huge difference in our game and we will avoid wasting CPU resources
    in reading from disk.'
  id: totrans-42
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are other cases to consider, but those can be extrapolated based on the
    previous ones. Remember that the previous analysis was made by taking into account
    the requirements of the standard game, but this can vary a lot according to your
    game and your target device. Maybe you are making a game that won't consume lots
    of RAM but is pretty intensive in terms of CPU resources, in which case you can
    just put everything in Decompress on Load. It's important to consider all aspects
    of your game and to balance your resources accordingly.

    the way Unity will encode the audio in the published game. Different compression
    formats will give different compression ratios in exchange for less fidelity with
    the original audio, or higher decompression times, and all this varies a lot based
    on the audio patterns and length. We have three compression formats:'
  id: totrans-44

    no noise artifacts, but will result in a bigger asset file size.'

    types of audio.'

  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Vorbis**: A high-quality compression format that will yield almost zero artifacts
    but takes longer to decompress, so playing Vorbis audio will be slightly more
    intensive than for other formats. It also provides a quality slider to select
    the exact amount of compression aggressiveness.'
  id: totrans-47
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Which one should you use? Again, that depends on the features of your audio.
    Short smooth audio can use PCM, while long noisy audio can use ADPCM; the artifacts
    introduced by this format will be hidden in the audio itself. Maybe long smooth
    audio where compression artifacts are noticeable could benefit from using Vorbis.
    Sometimes, it's just a matter of trial and error. Maybe use Vorbis by default
    and when performance is reduced, try to switch to ADPCM, and if that causes glitches,
    just switch to PCM. Of course, the problem here is being sure that the audio processing
    is really what's responsible for the performance issues – maybe switching all
    audio to ADPCM and checking whether that made a difference is a good way to detect
    that, but a better approach would be to use the Profiler, a performance measurement
    tool that we will see later in this book.

- en: Something to consider in the case of 3D sounds is the **Volume Rolloff** setting,
    which is inside the 3D sound settings section. This setting controls how the volume
    decays over distance to the camera. By default, you can see that this setting
    is set to **Logarithmic Rolloff**, the way real-life sound works, but sometimes
    you don't want real-life sound decay, because sounds in real life are usually
    heard slightly even if the source is very far away.

    are organized in a hierarchy, where a group can also contain other groups, so
    a change in a group will also apply changes to its sub-groups. As a matter of

    the group that will affect every single sound in the game (that uses that mixer).

    pause menu case, where the SFX volume should be lower. To handle those scenarios,
    we can create snapshots, which are presets of our mixer that can be activated
