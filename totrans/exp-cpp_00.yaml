    C++17 and C++20 standards, and how they are compiled, linked, and executed. It
    will also cover how memory management works, what the best practices are as regards
    memory management problems, what classes are and how they are implemented, how
    a compiler optimizes code, and what the compiler's approach is in terms of supporting
    class inheritance, virtual functions, and templates.
