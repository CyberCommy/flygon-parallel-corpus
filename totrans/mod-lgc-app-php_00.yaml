- en: I have been programming professionally in one capacity or another for over 30
    years. I continue to find it a challenging and rewarding career. I still learn
    new lessons about my profession every day, as I think is the case for every programmer
    dedicated to this craft.

- en: Even more challenging and rewarding is helping other programmers to learn what
    I have learned. I have worked with PHP for 15 years now, in many different kinds
    of organizations and in every capacity from junior developer to VP of Engineering.
    In that time, I have learned a lot about the commonalities in legacy PHP applications.
    This book is distilled from my notes and memories from modernizing those codebases.
    I hope it can serve as a path for other programmers to follow, leading them out
    of a morass of bad code and bad work situations, and into a better life for themselves.

- en: This book also serves as penance for all of the legacy code I have left behind
    for others to deal with. All I can say is that I didn't know then what I know
    now. In part, I offer this book as atonement for the coding sins of my past. I
    hope it can help you to avoid my previous mistakes.
