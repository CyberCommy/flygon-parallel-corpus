- en: IPCop is a Linux-based, stateful firewall distribution that sits in between
    your Internet connection and your network and directs traffic using a set of rules
    framed by you. It provides most of the features that you would expect a modern
    firewall to have, and what is most important is that it sets this all up for you
    in a highly automated and simplified way.

- en: This book is an easy-to-read guide to using IPCop in a variety of different
    roles within the network. The book is written in a very friendly style that makes
    this complex topic easy and a joy to read. It first covers basic IPCop concepts,
    then moves to introduce basic IPCop configurations, before covering advanced uses
    of IPCop. This book is for both experienced and new IPCop users.

- en: IPCop runs on a dedicated box, and it *completely takes over the hard drive*,
    so don't use a drive with anything valuable on it. It will run on old or "obsolete"
    hardware, such as a 386 processor, 32Mb of RAM, and 300Mb hard disk. But if you
    plan on using some of IPCop's features, such as the caching web proxy, or Intrusion
    Detection Logging, you are going to need more RAM, more disk space, and a faster
    processor.

    IPCop box, as it runs as a *headless* server, and is administered over the network
    with a web browser.
