- en: In this book, the goal is to build a solid foundation of learning all the essentials
    of the Linux command line to get you started. It has been designed to strongly
    focus on learning only the practical core skills and essential Linux knowledge,
    which is really important when beginning this wonderful OS in an easy way. All
    the examples shown in this course have been carefully chosen to be everyday and
    real-world tasks, use cases, and problems Linux beginners or system administrators
    will probably encounter when starting out from scratch. We begin our journey with
    the virtualization software and install CentOS 7 Linux as a VM. Then, we will
    gently introduce you to the most basic command-line operations, such as cursor
    movement, commands, options and arguments, history, quoting and globbing, file
    streams and pipes, and getting help, and then introduce you to the wonderful art
    of regular expressions and how to work with files. Then, the most essential everyday
    Linux commands are demonstrated and explained, and a compact introduction to Bash
    shell scripting provided. Finally, the reader is introduced to advanced topics
    such as networking, how to troubleshoot your system, advanced file permissions,
    ACL, setuid, setgid, and sticky bit. This is just the starting point and there
    is so much more you can learn about Linux.
