- en: Welcome to *The Python Apprentice*! Our goal with this book is to give you a
    practical and thorough introduction to the Python programming language, providing
    you with the tools and insight you need to be a productive member of nearly any
    Python project. Python is a big language, and it’s not our intention with this
    book to cover everything there is to know. Rather we want to help you build solid
    foundations, orient you in the sometimes bewildering universe of Python, and put
    you in a position to direct your own continued learning.

- en: This book is primarily aimed at people with some experience programming in another
    language. If you’re currently programming in any of the mainstream imperative
    or object-oriented languages like C++, C#, or Java, then you’ll have the background
    you need to get the most out of this book. If you have experience in other types
    of languages – for example, functional or actor-based – then you may have a bit
    steeper learning curve with Python, but you won’t encounter any serious difficulties.
    Most programmers find Python very approachable and intuitive, and with just a
    little practice they quickly become comfortable with it.

- en: On the other hand, if you don’t have *any* experience with programming this
    book may be a bit daunting. You’ll be learning not just a programming language
    but many of the topics and issues common to all languages at the same time. And
    to be fair, we don’t spend a lot of time trying to explain these areas of “assumed
    knowledge”. **This doesn’t mean you can’t learn from this book!** It just means
    that you might have to work a bit harder, read sections multiple times, and perhaps
    get guidance from others. The reward for this effort, though, is that you’ll start
    to develop the knowledge and instincts for approaching other languages, and this
    is a critical skill for the professional programmer.

- en: 'In this first chapter we’ll take a quick tour of the Python language. We’ll
    cover what Python is (hint: it’s more than just a language!), take a look at how
    it was – and still is – developed, and get a sense of what makes it so appealing
    to so many programmers. We’ll also give a brief preview of how the rest of the
    book is structured.'
