    quick peek at Spacewar! and its arcade version, Computer Space, Pong, Gun fight,
    and many other games from ancient times. The first thing you will notice is not
    the difference in gameplay but the lack of graphical splendor. The development
    of faster computers and dedicated graphical processors has made games increasingly
    pretty to look at. There was certainly a general trend towards more realism: how
    much can we make a game look like a real-life one without burning our processors
    to a crisp? It''s a bit like what happened with paintings in general. Painters
    tended to strive towards more detail, a better approximation of what you would
    see in real life. It was a challenge to do, until they started using optical lenses
    to reflect an image directly to the canvas. All they then had to do was trace
    and color it. Artists started looking at new ways to express themselves on a canvas
    since perfection was not a guarantee for success any longer. Centuries after graphical
    perfection was reached, the world saw paintings like Pablo Picasso''s Guernica
    and the Scream of Edvard Munch. Neither of these is even close to reaching perfect
    realism; they both have something to intrigue people though.'

    proven we can come terrifyingly close to realism, and some game developers have
    begun looking for more original looks. For example, Nintendo has never strived
    to come close to delivering realistic graphics, yet their skill in producing great
    games is revered all over the world. This is because they understand that stirring
    up a certain feeling in the player is more important than showing the same thing
    a player would see by looking away from their screen.

    by pixel is the most ambitious one. Great artists can get really nice results
    with this, but even the most experienced pixel artist will spend several hours
    on just a few characters and tilesets. There are several tools out there to help
    you transfer your own drawing skill to the PC, such as the digital drawing pen
    and software: Adobe Photoshop or it''s free counterpart GIMP. If you have no experience

- en: The second option is vector graphic design. Vector graphics differ from pixel
    art in that drawings are built up with lines and basic forms, not individual dots.
    These lines and forms are freely scalable to both higher and lower resolutions,
    whereas for pixel art, this can be very difficult. Building up drawings from basic
    forms such as the rectangle, circle, and lines require a different kind of insight
    than regular drawing does. The prerequisite to making graphics is basically transferred
    from needing a steady hand to having an analytical view on objects and life forms.
    Take the birds from Angry Birds as an example. Their basic form is a circle with
    circular eyes placed in the center. Their beaks are somewhat rounded triangles
    and their eyebrows and tails are nothing more than a collection of rectangles.
    If you look at these angry birds from this more analytical point of view, it becomes
    easier to draw one yourself. If you feel you have that somewhat analytical insight,
    even if your drawing skills are only average, you can make your own tilesets if
    you put in enough effort. In this chapter there will be a short introduction on
    how to do this.

    those into tilesets, you can quickly have some graphics at your disposal. While
    getting close to a realistic scene is very difficult for 3D games, it's actually
    the easiest way to go in 2D games. The main problem here of course is the fact
    that you cannot distinguish yourself easily from competitors if you use adjusted
    pictures, which is a real drawback while marketing your game. Nevertheless, the
    graphics look nice and it's a quick and cheap way to get them.

    we can make the design look even more realistic. As an exercise, you could add
    your own animation for when the character is idling. For instance, a person would
    inhale and exhale, making his or her chest go up and down. To portray this, you
    can add one extra image, making the game feel even more alive. Eventually, we
    end up with our final robot. Teaching it how to walk is then a matter of putting
    the best foot forward, followed by the other one of course. If you work in a single
    layer, it can be done by bringing a leg and arm to the front by selecting them
    and pressing the *Home* key. Pressing the *End* key will position the selected
    arm behind the other forms. Alternatively, you can use the **Object** menu to
    achieve the same thing. Ideally though, you would want to work with different
    layers, since this makes life a lot easier. However, we won't go into that level
    of detail here.

    A background map differs from a regular level layer in the way it is drawn by
    a code array you supply in your scripts instead of the standard JSON-coded level
    files. This way it is possible to set up recurring backgrounds.

  zh: 在ImpactJS中使用背景地图时，预渲染它们可能会很有用。背景地图与常规级别图层不同，它是通过您在脚本中提供的代码数组绘制的，而不是标准的JSON编码级别文件。这样就可以设置重复的背景。

- en: 'Prerendering the background will make the system create chunks, which are a
    collection of tiles. Choosing to prerender will require more RAM since larger
    pieces need to be kept in memory but will speed up the drawing process; this way
    there is less taxation on the device''s processor. Knowing that you have this
    option and depending on whether you think RAM or processing power will be the
    bottleneck, you can choose to either prerender your background or not by use of
    the ImpactJS `.prerender` property. In addition you can set the chunk size to
    fine-tune the balance between the two resources:'

  zh: 预渲染背景将使系统创建块，这是一组瓷砖。选择预渲染将需要更多的RAM，因为需要将更大的块保留在内存中，但会加快绘图过程；这样设备的处理器上的负担就会减少。知道你有这个选项，并根据你认为RAM还是处理能力将成为瓶颈，你可以选择通过使用ImpactJS的`.prerender`属性来预渲染背景或不预渲染。此外，你可以设置块的大小来微调两种资源之间的平衡：

- en: 'Graphics are an important element of any game as they are the visualization
    of everything your game represents. Though there has certainly been a trend towards
    more realistic graphics in games, it is not absolutely required for a good game
    experience. We talked about whether you should make or buy your graphics and where
    you can buy custom graphics at an affordable price. We distinguished three important
    options if you decide to create your own graphics: pixel graphics, vector graphics,
    and using Adobe Photoshop reality. Skipping the first option, we took a quick
    look at how to develop vector graphics with Inkscape and add yourself to your
    game using Adobe Photoshop. The chapter ended with some hints on working with
    graphics in the game. In the next chapter, it''s finally time to show our game
    to the world as we get to deploy it to several distribution channels ranging from
    a regular website to Google Play.'

  zh: 图形是任何游戏的重要元素，因为它们是游戏所代表的一切的可视化。尽管游戏中的图形确实趋向于更加逼真，但这并不是获得良好游戏体验的绝对要求。我们讨论了是否应该制作或购买图形，以及在哪里可以以实惠的价格购买定制图形。如果决定创建自己的图形，我们区分了三个重要选项：像素图形、矢量图形，以及使用Adobe
    Photoshop。跳过第一个选项，我们快速了解了如何使用Inkscape开发矢量图形，并使用Adobe Photoshop将自己添加到游戏中。本章以一些关于在游戏中使用图形的提示结束。在下一章中，我们终于可以向世界展示我们的游戏，因为我们将把它部署到从常规网站到Google
    Play等多个分发渠道。
