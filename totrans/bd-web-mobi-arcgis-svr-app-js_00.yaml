- en: ArcGIS Server is the predominant platform used to develop GIS applications for
    the Web. There are a number of programming languages you can use to develop applications
    with ArcGIS Server, including JavaScript, Flex, and Silverlight. JavaScript has
    become the preferred language for developing applications on this platform, since
    it can be used for both web and mobile applications and doesn't require the installation
    of a plugin for the application to be used in a browser. Flex and Silverlight
    both fall short as languages for mobile development and both require the use of
    a plugin for the application to run in a browser.

- en: This book will teach you how to build web-based GIS applications using the ArcGIS
    API for JavaScript. Using a practical, hands-on style of learning, you will learn
    how to develop fully functional applications with ArcGIS Server and develop a
    skill set that is in high demand.

- en: You will learn how to create maps and add geographic layers from a variety of
    sources, including tiled and dynamic map services. In addition, you'll learn how
    to add graphics to the map and stream geographic features to the browser using
    `FeatureLayer`. Most applications also include specific functionalities implemented
    by ArcGIS Server as tasks. You'll learn how to use the various tasks provided
    by ArcGIS Server, including queries, identification of features, finding features
    by attributes, geoprocessing tasks, and more. Finally, you'll learn just how easy
    it is to develop mobile applications with the ArcGIS API for JavaScript.

    *Introduction to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript*, covers fundamental HTML, CSS, and
    JavaScript concepts before getting started with developing GIS applications with
    the ArcGIS API for JavaScript.'

- en: '[Chapter 2](ch02.html "Chapter 2. Creating Maps and Adding Layers"), *Creating
    Maps and Adding Layers*, teaches you how to create a map and add layers to the
    map. You will learn how to create an instance of the `Map` class, add layers of
    data to the map, and display this information on a web page. The `Map` class is
    the most fundamental class in the API as it provides the canvas for your data
    layers and any subsequent activities that occur in your application. However,
    your map is useless until you add layers of data. There are several types of data
    layers that can be added to a map, including tiled, dynamic, and feature. Readers
    will learn more about each of these layer types in this chapter.'

    to the Map*, teaches the reader how to display temporary points, lines, and polygons
    in `GraphicsLayer` on the map. `GraphicsLayer` is a separate layer that always
    resides on top of other layers and stores all the graphics associated with the
    map.'

- en: '[Chapter 4](ch04.html "Chapter 4. The Feature Layer"), *The Feature Layer*,
    offers additional capabilities`,` apart from inheriting from `GraphicsLayer,`
    such as the ability to perform queries and selections. Feature layers are also
    used for online editing of features. Feature layers differ from tiled and dynamic
    map service layers, because feature layers bring geometry information to the client
    computer to be drawn and stored by the web browser. Feature layers potentially
    cut down on round trips to the server. A client can request the features it needs,
    and perform selections and queries on those features without having to request
    more information from the server.'

    and Toolbars*, covers out-of-the-box widgets that you can drop into your application
    for enhanced productivity. The BasemapGallery, Bookmarks, Print, Geocoding, Legend,
    Measurement, Scalebar, Gauge, and Overview map widgets are included. In addition,
    the ArcGIS API for JavaScript also includes helper classes for adding various
    toolbars to your applications, including navigation and drawing toolbars.'

    *Performing Spatial and Attribute Queries*, covers the ArcGIS Server Query Task,
    which allows you to perform attribute and spatial queries against data layers
    in a map service that have been exposed. You can also combine these query types
    to perform a combination attribute and spatial query.'

    and Finding Features*, covers two common operations found in any GIS application.
    These operations require that the user click a feature on the map in the case
    of identification, or perform a query in the case of finding features. In either
    case, information about particular features is returned. In this chapter, the
    reader will learn how to use the `IdentifyTask` and `FindTask` objects to obtain
    information about features.'

    into Addresses"), *Turning Addresses into Points and Points into Addresses*, covers
    the use of the Locator task to perform geocoding and reverse geocoding. Geocoding
    is the process of assigning a coordinate to an address, while reverse geocoding
    assigns an address to a coordinate.'

    Tasks*, allows you to perform analyses on street networks, such as finding the
    best route from one address to another, finding the closest school, identifying
    a service area around a location, or responding to a set of orders with a fleet
    of service vehicles.'

- en: '[Chapter 10](ch10.html "Chapter 10. Geoprocessing Tasks"), *Geoprocessing Tasks*,
    allows you to execute custom models built in ArcGIS Desktop using ModelBuilder.
    Models are run in an automated fashion from either a desktop environment or via
    a centralized server accessed through a web application. Any tool found in ArcToolbox,
    whether that be a tool for your ArcGIS license level or a custom tool that you''ve
    built, can be used in a model and chained together with other tools. Once constructed,
    these models can be run on a centralized server and accessed via web applications.
    In this chapter, we will examine how you can access these geoprocessing tasks
    through the ArcGIS API for JavaScript.'

    access the data and maps created with [ArcGIS.com](http://ArcGIS.com). The website
    [ArcGIS.com](http://ArcGIS.com) is for working with maps and other types of geographic
    information. On this site, you will find applications for building and sharing
    maps. You will also find useful basemaps, data, applications, and tools that you
    can view and use, plus communities you can join. For application developers, the
    really exciting news is that you can integrate [ArcGIS.com](http://ArcGIS.com)
    content into your custom developed applications using the ArcGIS API for JavaScript.
    In this chapter, you will explore how [ArcGIS.com](http://ArcGIS.com) maps can
    be added to your applications.'

    Google Chrome or Firefox. Each chapter contains exercises designed to supplement
    the material presented. Exercises will be completed using the ArcGIS API for JavaScript
    Sandbox to write and test your code. The Sandbox can be found at [http://developers.arcgis.com/en/javascript/sandbox/sandbox.html](http://developers.arcgis.com/en/javascript/sandbox/sandbox.html).
    The exercises will access publicly available instances of ArcGIS Server, so it
    will not be necessary for you to install ArcGIS Server.

- en: If you are an application developer who wants to develop web and mobile GIS
    applications using ArcGIS Server and the API for JavaScript, this book is ideal
    for you. It is primarily oriented towards beginners and intermediate-level GIS
    developers or application developers who are more traditional and may not have
    developed GIS applications in the past, but are now tasked with implementing solutions
    on this platform. No prior experience with ArcGIS Server, JavaScript, HTML, or
    CSS is expected, but it is certainly helpful.
