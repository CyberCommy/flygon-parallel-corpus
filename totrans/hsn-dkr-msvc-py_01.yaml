    Design, Plan, Execute*, describes a typical situation for a monolith system, its
    problems, and how the move to microservices can improve the development speed
    and independent features implementation. It also produces a plan in several steps
    to facilitate making the move from the initial unique monolith to a multiple RESTful
    microservice. It also introduces using Docker to implement the different microservices
    as containers.'
