    break into an internal network from over the Internet without phishing the organization's
    populace. There are occasionally widely exposed networks, but the majority of
    organizations have learned to tighten their external perimeters. Unfortunately,
    there is still the systemic problem of a hard exterior, and then a softer interior
    with light monitoring controls, which are not structured to prevent real malicious
    actors from compromising resources. This means that we should simulate the activity
    that malicious actors execute to crack the perimeter. This in turn means understanding
    what the typical perimeter looks like today.

    to be either locally present at the client or server side of the communication,
    or in the channel through the routed path. The second method is by compromising
    a system that stores these credentials. The third is by executing some type of
    social engineering attack, which means that if a user is susceptible to the attack,
    those credentials may warrant access to many other services as well and not only
    clear text protocols. The fourth is by executing an online credential attack against
    the service, such as a password spray, dictionary attack, or brute force. This
    is not to say that there is no risk related to clear-text protocols, but instead
    to point out that it is more difficult to exploit than what the VMS solutions

    These applications can be on a variety of ports, including nonstandard ports.
    They are often load balanced and potentially served through complex **Content
    Delivery Networks** (**CDN**), which effectively serve cached versions of the
    material provided from servers closer to the requesting user base. Additionally,
    these applications can be served from virtualized platforms that are sandboxed
    from other systems, within a provider's environment. So, even if you do crack
    the web application, you may not gain access to the target network. Keep this
    in mind if you are wondering why you cannot get anywhere after cracking the web
    application system. Also ensure that you have permission to test networks that
    are not controlled by the client.
