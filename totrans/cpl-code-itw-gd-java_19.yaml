    This chapter covers the most popular questions surrounding these two topics. These
    four chapters are bonus chapters; the approach of which is not similar to the
    chapters you've read so far. Owing to the nature of the topics, we will touch
    upon them briefly, elaborating on the questions asked in interviews on the respective
    topics. You can find the codes used in the chapter on the GitHub repository, link
