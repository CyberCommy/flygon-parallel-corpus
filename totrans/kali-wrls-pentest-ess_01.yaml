- en: Penetration testing is the process of simulating attacks against a system or
    a network to point out its misconfigurations, weaknesses, or security vulnerabilities
    and their relative exploits that could be used by real attackers to gain access
    to the system or network.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The process of identifying and evaluating vulnerabilities is called **vulnerability
    assessment** and it is sometimes used as a synonym for penetration testing, but
    they are actually distinct processes; indeed, penetration testing generally includes
    vulnerability assessment and also the successive attack phase to practically exploit
    the vulnerabilities that are found. In some cases, depending on the scope of the
    penetration test, a full vulnerability assessment is not required as the penetration
    test may only focus on specific vulnerabilities to attack.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A penetration test can be external or internal. An external penetration test
    (sometimes also referred as a *black box* penetration test) tries to simulate
    a real external attack, with no prior information about the target systems and
    networks being given to penetration testers, while an internal penetration test
    (also referred as *white box*) is performed by penetration testers who are given
    access as insiders and try to exploit the network vulnerabilities to increase
    their privileges and do things they are not authorized to do, for example, launching
    man-in-the-middle attacks, as we will see in [Chapter 7](ch07.html "Chapter 7. Wireless
    Client Attacks"), *Wireless Client Attacks*.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The planning phase is a crucial part of penetration testing, though it is not
    always given the importance that it should have. In this phase, we define the
    scope and the so-called *rules of engagement* of a penetration test, as a result
    of an agreement between the penetration testers and the client that will be formalized
    in a contract between the two parties. It must be clear that a penetration tester
    should never operate without a contract or outside the scope and the rules of
    engagement established in the contract, because otherwise he/she could stumble
    into serious legal troubles. The scope is about which networks to test and the
    goals and objectives the client wants to achieve with the penetration test.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this, we need to consider, for example, the area to scan for wireless networks,
    the coverage range of the signal of the networks to test, and their size in terms
    of the number of clients that will supposedly be connected. We also define the
    objectives of the test, such as specific vulnerabilities that should be assessed
    and their priorities; whether rogue and hidden access points should be enumerated
    and whether wireless attacks against clients should be conducted.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The rules of engagement include, among others, the estimated timeline and the
    days and times when to perform the test, the legal authorization from the client,
    the format of the report to produce, payment terms, and a nondisclosure agreement
    clause, according to which the results of the test are kept confidential by the
    testers.

- en: In the discovery phase, we collect as much information as possible about the
    networks that are in the scope of the penetration test. This phase is also called
    the information gathering phase and it is very important because it precisely
    defines the targets of our test and allows to collect detailed information about
    them and to expose their potential vulnerabilities.

- en: The discovery phase could be realized through two main types of wireless network
    scanning, **active** and **passive**. Active scanning implies sending out probe
    request packets to identify *visible* access points, while passive scanning means
    capturing and analyzing all wireless traffic and also allowing to uncover hidden
    access points.

    included in Kali Linux, such as airmon, airodump, and Kismet, to carry out the
    discovery phase of wireless penetration testing in [Chapter 3](ch03.html "Chapter 3. WLAN
    Reconnaissance"), *WLAN Reconnaissance*.

- en: The attack phase
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The attack phase is the most practical part of the penetration testing process,
    where we try to exploit the vulnerabilities identified in the discovery phase
    to gain access to the target networks.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is called the *exploitation* subphase and in our case could involve attempting
    to crack authentication keys to connect to the network, setting up rogue and honeypot
    access points and directly attacking clients to recover the keys. The next stage
    (if required in the contract) is referred to as *post-exploitation* and involves
    attacking the network and the infrastructure after we have gained access to it,
    for example, taking control of the access points and performing man-in-the-middle
    attacks against the clients.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It is worth repeating that we should never conduct attacks that are not explicitly
    required in the contract. Moreover, the attack phase should be performed according
    to the terms and modalities established with the client, defined in the rules
    of engagement. For example, if the targets are production systems or networks,
    we could agree with the client to conduct such attacks outside the working hours,
    as wireless connectivity and the services provided may be disrupted.

  prefs:

- en: Reporting is the final phase of penetration testing. The previous phases are
    very important because they are where we plan and execute the test but it is still
    important to communicate its results and findings in an effective manner to the
    client. The report is useful as a reference point for defining countermeasures
    and mitigation activities to address the identified vulnerabilities. It is usually
    formed by two major sections, the executive summary and the technical report.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The executive summary is a high-level summary of the objectives, methods and
    findings of the test and it is mainly intended for the non-technical management.
    Thus, the summary should be written in a clear language and using an understandable
    terminology, avoiding too many technical terms and expressions.

    and detailed information about the findings of the discovery and attack phases,
    as well as an assessment of the risk that the identified vulnerabilities entail
    for the client and a plan for risk mitigation. Thus, the technical report covers
    the same as the executive summary but from a technical point of view and it is
    addressed mainly to IT executives that should then apply the remediation activities
    provided in the report.
