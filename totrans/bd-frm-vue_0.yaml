- en: Vue.js is one of the world's leading and fastest growing frameworks for frontend
    development. Its gentle learning curve and vibrant and helpful community have
    made it an easy choice for many new developers looking to harness the power of
    frontend frameworks. Additionally, its flexibility and power have made it an easy
    choice for advanced developers and companies to use it as their main tool for
    powerful, dynamic, and lean applications and websites.

    development—forms. We will journey together, from creating the most basic forms
    all the way through to understanding how a fully dynamic, schema-driven form works.

    be building on throughout the book. It is recommended that you work through the
    book in the order of the chapters, as they build on the concepts learned in the
    previous ones. However, the completed code for each chapter will be provided at
    the beginning of each in case you want to skip forward.'

    Form Components*, will teach you how to break down a form into components that
    can be reused throughout your application. You will understand how the `v-model`
