    of a fresh new project folder is pretty exciting. Sadly, it soon devolves into
    a mess of folders, subfolders, and hastily written markup and before you know
    it, it is launch day and you realize with horror you have a page that is missing
    some essential metadata (uh those favicons!), some sections are unreadable in
    some browsers—what? It needs to look good when printed too?

    Safari 4 and higher, IE6 and higher, Firefox 3.5 and higher, and Chrome.

    and outputs a set of classes on the HTML element based on their presence or absence
    in the browser that is loading your website. For example, if a browser lacks support
    for border radius, Modernizr outputs the class `no-borderradius` , while on browsers
    that support border radius, it will output the class `borderradius` . A custom
    build of Modernizr is included within Boilerplate.

    function to debug your JavaScript code. How many times have you forgotten to remove
    them or comment them out in production, only to find them throwing errors in Internet
    Explorer or other browsers that do not support the use of this function? You can
