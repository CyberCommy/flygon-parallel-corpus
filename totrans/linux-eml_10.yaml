- en: In order to recover from catastrophic loss of service in case of a major hardware
    or software malfunction, it is absolutely essential to have a backup. The backup
    is supposed to let you restore the software (or rather the software's configuration)
    and other data that you need to reestablish your service. This includes the users'
    mails, the system's mail queue, and their authentication data among other things.

    to juggle the cost of downtime to a business, the price and availability of backup
    media and hardware, the value of user data (in our case, users' e-mails), and
    the staffing costs to manage the backup operations.

    is to have a spare Linux machine, with a number of hard drives, networked to our
    e-mail server, preferably located in another building. Storing backups off site
    is essential if we want to protect ourselves from a catastrophic event such as
    fire.

- en: If a remote server is not available, an alternative could be some hot-swappable
    external hard drives connected to the server, or even, in a pinch, a DVD burner.
    Magnetic tape drives are also an option, but often the cost of the tape drive
    and media is greater than the server. If removable media is the only option then
    don't leave the backups stacked on top of the server or in a desk drawer, move
    them to a safe off site location. It may be convenient to retain a local copy
    of the latest backup media on site to respond more quickly to urgent recovery
    situations.

- en: '**RAID** is an acronym for a **Redundant Array** of **Inexpensive** (or **Independent**)**Disks**.
    By using multiple disks in a RAID setup, data is spread across the disks, but
    the array is viewed by the operating system as a single device. By replicating
    and dividing the data throughout the array, the tolerance to disk failure can
    be reduced significantly, increasing data reliability and possibly I/O performance.
    If a hard disk fails in the array, the old disk can be swapped out and replaced
    with a new disk. The RAID controller, either a hardware or software controller,
    then reconstructs the data. For more information on RAID and the various configuration
    options available, visit [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAID](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAID).'

    been deleted, whether accidentally or maliciously, cannot be recovered. RAID does
    not protect from user error or serious hardware failure such as a power surge
    that fries the server or even fire damage.

    to back up our server's configuration because it is essential to our server's
    functionality. But we also want to back up the users' data because it is a valuable
    asset to our business. Is there a company policy that says people may use e-mail
    for private communication? If there is, should we back up those messages as well?

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: After all, the space on any backup media is limited and thus precious. It is
    more important to back up all the users' mails than to have a complete backup
    of the `/tmp` directory. Also, the less data we back up, the less time is required
    to perform the backup, thus returning our system's resources (CPU cycles, I/O
    bandwidth) more quickly to their main purpose—handling users' mails.

- en: '`dump -0 -u -b 1024 -f -` performs a level `0` (`full`) dump of the partition
    `/dev/sdb1` (which contains `/home` in our example) using a block size of `1024`
    (for maximum performance) and updates (`-u`) the file `/var/lib/dumpdates` after
    the dump had been successful. The `-u` option is important because it records
    the date and time of this dump, so subsequent incremental dumps can determine
    which files have been changed or created since the last dump. The output of the
    dump goes to a file (`-f`) specified as (`-`), which indicates `stdout`, the standard
    output.'

    makes a remote connection to the system `backup-host.domain.com` logging in as
    `user`. Once logged in, the remote system executes the `dd` command. We recommend
    the use of the key-based authentication scheme that `ssh` offers. This way, the
    backup can run unattended, as nobody has to enter the password needed to log in
    as `user` on `backup-host.domain.com`.

    has been constructed in such a way as to easily identify the file system, the
    date and time the dump was taken, the level of the dump, and the suffix `.gz`
    to indicate that this dump file has been compressed. The filename portion `$(date
    +%Y%m%d%H%M%S`) is a shell expansion performed on the local system (not the remote
    system) to output the current date and time in `YYYYMMDDHHMMSS` format. The final
