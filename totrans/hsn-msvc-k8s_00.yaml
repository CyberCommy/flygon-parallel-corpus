- en: '*Hands-On Microservices with Kubernetes* is the book you have been waiting
    for. It will walk you though the parallel paths of developing microservices and
    deploying them on Kubernetes. The synergy between microservice-based architecture
    and Kubernetes is very powerful. This book covers all angles. It explains the
    concepts behind microservices and Kubernetes, discusses real-world concerns and
    trade-offs, takes you through the development of fully fledged microservice-based
    systems, shows you best practices, and provides ample recommendations.'

- en: This book covers an amazing amount of ground in great depth and with working
    code to illustrate. You will learn how to design a microservice-based architecture,
    build microservices, test the microservices you've built, and package them as
    Docker images. Then, you will learn how to deploy your system as a collection
    of Docker images to Kubernetes and manage it there.

    of, such as automated **continuous integration** / **continuous delivery** (**CI**/**CD**)
    , gRPC-based microservices, serverless computing, and service meshes.

    experience with planning, developing, and operating large-scale cloud-native systems
    using microservice-based architecture deployed on Kubernetes.

- en: This book is targeted at software developers and DevOps engineers who want to
    be at the forefront of large-scale software engineering. It will help if you have
    experience with large-scale software systems that are deployed using containers
    on more than one machine and are developed by several teams.

    interact with it from outside the cluster. Also, we will add a gRPC-based news
    service that users can hit up to get news about other users they follow. Finally,
    we will add a message queue that lets services communicate in a loosely coupled
