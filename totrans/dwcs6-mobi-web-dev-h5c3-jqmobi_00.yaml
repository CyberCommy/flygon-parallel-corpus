- en: This book goes to press at a time of radical developments in the evolution of
    web design. Mobile design is no longer an afterthought but integral to the process
    of building websites from conception to completion. New features in HTML5, CSS3,
    and JavaScript have eclipsed older technologies for animation and interactivity.
    Native video has supplanted plugin-based media. Moreover, new HTML5 and CSS3 tools
    have brought about a sea of change in everything from form design to graphical
    styling.

    using the latest technology and approaches—HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. It demonstrates
    how to create or customize pages with HTML5 layouts and add HMTL5 native audio
    and video to these pages. Then you will learn to add CSS3 effects to web pages
    using Dreamweaver, and sometimes push beyond the features available in Dreamweaver.

    CS6's tools for responsive design, to adjust the display to match a user's device,
    to learn how to build jQuery-based web apps, and to learn how to convert those
    web apps to free-standing apps that run without a browser. By the time you're
    finished, you'll have learned several techniques to use the latest features of
    Dreamweaver for web and mobile development.
