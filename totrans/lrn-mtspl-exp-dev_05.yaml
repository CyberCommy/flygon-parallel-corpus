    the approach that should be adopted for client exploitation. Now we slowly move
    on to the exploitation principles in depth, with the first phase as information
    gathering. We explain the various techniques through which we can gather information
    of our victim for pre-attack analysis. This information is used to know our victim
    better and gather platform-rich information for attacking the system. The rise
    in the amount of vulnerabilities has made us shift to using automated vulnerability
    scanners. This chapter is aimed at mastering the art of vulnerability scanning,
    which is the first step towards exploitation. Some of the modules that would be

- en: Information gathering is a process of collecting information about a victim
    through various techniques. This is basically divided into two steps of footprinting
    and scanning. A lot of information is available publicly about an organization
    through the organization's website, business news, job portals, disgruntled employees,
    and so on. A malicious user may be able to find domain names belonging to an organization,
    remote access information, network architecture, public IP addresses, and much
    more through this phase.

    tools in its kit for information gathering and analysis. Some of these include:
    Nmap, Nessus with Postgres support for porting the report, followed by exploitation
    using the gathered information through Metasploit, and so on. Metasploit is already
    integrated with Postgres, which indirectly helps in storing penetration testing
    results for longer duration during the testing phase. The information gathering
    phase is considered so important because attackers use these tools to gather important
    information for compromising their victim. The Metasploit auxiliary modules have
    various scans from ARP to SYN, and even service-based scans such as HTTP, SMB,
    SQL, and SSH. These actually help in fingerprinting the service version and even
    some information about probable platforms on which the service is being used.
    So, through these specifications our attack domain gets further restricted in
    hitting the victim really hard.'

    Let us suppose we are the attacker, and we have a domain which has to be exploited.
    The first step should be to retrieve all the information about the domain for
    our malicious purpose. `Whois` is one of the best methods for information gathering.
    It is widely used for querying databases that store registered users of an Internet
    resource such as domain name, IP address, and so on.

    work? Whenever Nmap performs a scan, it delivers an ICMP echo request to the destination
    for checking whether the host is alive or dead. This process saves much time for
    Nmap when it scans multiple hosts at a time. Sometimes ICMP requests are blocked
    by firewalls, so as a secondary check Nmap tries to connect to default open ports,
    such as 80 and 443, which are used by the web server or HTTP.

    which is used for scanning network vulnerabilities externally. The second is internal
    network scan, which is used for scanning network vulnerabilities internally. The
    third is Web App Tests, which is used for scanning web application for vulnerabilities.
    The fourth one is PCI-DSS (Payment Card Industry-data Security Standard) audits,
    which is used in the Payment Card Industry as the data security standard.

    to create a new scan, and the command used is `nessus_new_scan <policy ID> <scan
    name> <Target IP>`; for example, here we are using `nessus_new_scan -2 WindowsXPscan
    192.168.0.103`.

- en: Importing a report of vulnerability scanners into the Metasploit database is
    a very useful feature provided by Metasploit. In this chapter, we used two scanners,
    which are Nmap and Nessus. We already saw the various scanning techniques of Nmap
    used in different circumstances. Now we will see how to import an Nmap report
    via `msfconsole` in PostgreSQL database.
  id: totrans-117

- en: Scan any host and save the Nmap report in XML format because `msfconsole` does
    not support TXT format. So here we already have a scan report in XML format named
    `scan.xml`. Now the first thing we have to do is to check the database for connectivity
    with the `msfconsole` using the command `db_status`.

    Nmap report. We use the command `db_import <report path with name>`; for example,
    here we are importing our report from the desktop, so we are giving `db_import
    /root/Desktop/scan.xml`.

    and the operating system version. Now after selecting the hosts, let us check
    for the open port details and the services running on those ports. The command

    simple as importing the Nmap report using the same command, which is `db_import

- en: In this chapter we have covered the various techniques for gathering information
    against a victim using the modules of Metasploit. We covered some freely available
    tools along with some auxiliary scanners. Using some of the auxiliary scanners
    we were actually able to fingerprint a particular running service. Through Nmap
    we learned to perform a network scan for live systems, firewall protected systems,
    and the various other scanning techniques which can be used in different scenarios.
    We saw that Nessus is a very big tool, which can be used for vulnerability assessment
    of a victim machine. We also learned to import Nmap and Nessus reports into Metasploit.
    With this chapter, we are already one step ahead in exploiting our victim, and
    will move on to covering client-side exploitation in the next chapter.
