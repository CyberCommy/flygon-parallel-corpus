- en: Web services has always been an important topic. With REST, things became simpler
    and better. Nowadays, RESTful web services are widely used. It was important a
    decade ago, but **Single Page Applications** (**SPAs**) and mobile applications
    have increased its usage greatly. The aim of this book is to educate PHP developers
    about the RESTful web services architecture, the current tools available to efficiently
    create RESTful web services such as a micro-framework named Lumen, automated API
    testing, the API testing framework, security and microservices architecture.

- en: Although this book is specific to PHP as we will be building RESTful web services
    in PHP7, it is neither just about PHP7 nor just about REST. RESTful web services
    and implementation in PHP is what we do in this book. However, you will learn
    a lot more than that. You will learn about some PHP features that are new in PHP7\.
    We will cover how we should structure our application and some common threats
    with respect to the web and web services. You will learn how to improve a basic
    RESTful web service and understand the importance of testing and the different
    types of testing. So it is not about just REST or PHP, but also about some minor
    but important programming-related stuff that is simple but makes things a lot
    better in the real world. At the end of this book, you will learn about an architecture
    named microservices.

    them beyond just PHP. So, this book is not a cookbook, but a journey in which
    you start learning about RESTful webservices and PHP7 and then start building
    RESTful web services. You can then keep improving your RESTful web services by
    learning about the problems in it and fixing those. During such improvements,
    you will learn the different things in PHP and benefit even beyond PHP.

    Introduction and Motivation*, introduces you to web services, REST architecture,
    the RESTful web services, and its comparison to other web services such as HTTP
    verbs and RESTful endpoints. It also explains web services through the example
    of a blog and then talk about the response format and response code.'

- en: Although I used Ubuntu, any operating system with PHP7 installed on it will
    work fine. The only thing required other than PHP7 will be an RDBMS. This book
    uses MySQL-related settings when connecting to database, so MySQL is ideal, but
    MariaDB or PostgreSQL will also be fine.
