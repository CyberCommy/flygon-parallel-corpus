    If it is in conformity, the controller will call the method of the corresponding
    view by sending the parameters in the URL. If you want to write URLs, you must
    first know the basics of regular expressions.

    and inaccessible air, they can manipulate the strings with great flexibility.
    They comprise a sequence of characters to define a pattern.

- en: We will not explore all the concepts of regular expressions in this book, because
    it would require several chapters and divert us from the main goal of this book.
    Practice your regular expressions before you write your first URLs; many sites
    help you train on regular expressions. Search for `Online regex matcher`, and
    you will find pages to check your regular expressions through JavaScript. You
    can further explore regular expressions through the book, *Mastering Regular Expressions
    Python*, *Packt Publishing*, written by Félix López. There is a practical tool
    to visualize regular expressions. This tool is called **Regexper** and was created
    by Jeff Avallone. We will use this to represent regular expressions as a diagram.

    `{x, y}`, where `x` defines the minimum number of occurrences and `y` is the maximum
    number of occurrences. If one of them is not specified, you will have an undefined
    value. For example, if you forget to include an element in `{2,}`, it means that
    the character must be present at least twice.
