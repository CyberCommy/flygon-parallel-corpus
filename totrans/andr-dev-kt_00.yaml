- en: Nowadays, the Android application development process is quite extensive. Over
    the last few years, we have seen how various tools have evolved to make our lives
    easier. However, one core element of Android application development process hasn’t
    changed much over time, Java. The Android platform adapts to newer versions of
    Java, but to be able to use them, we need to wait for a very long time until new
    Android devices reach proper market propagation. Also, developing applications
    in Java comes with its own set of challenges since Java is an old language with
    many design issues that can’t be simply resolved due to backward compatibility
    constraints.

- en: Kotlin, on the other hand, is a new but stable language that can run on all
    Android devices and solve many issues that Java cannot. It brings lots of proven
    programming concepts to the Android development table. It is a great language
    that makes a developer's life much easier and allows to produce more secure, expressive,
    and concise code.

- en: This book is an easy-to-follow, practical guide that will help you to speed
    up and improve the Android development process using Kotlin. We will present many
    shortcuts and improvements over Java and new ways of solving common problems.
    By the end of this book, you will be familiar with Kotlin features and tools,
    and you will be able to develop an Android application entirely in Kotlin.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 1](text00021.html) , *Beginning Your Kotlin Adventure* , discusses
    Kotlin language, its features and reasons to use it. We''ll introduce reader to
    the Kotlin platform and show how Kotlin fits into Android development process.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 2](text00035.html) , *Laying a Foundation* , is largely devoted to
    the building blocks of the Kotlin. It presents various constructs, data types,
    and features that make Kotlin an enjoyable language to work with.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 3](text00073.html) , *Playing with Functions* , explains various ways
    to define and call a function. We will also discuss function modifiers and look
    at possible locations where function can be defined.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 4](text00088.html) *, Classes and Objects* , discusses the Kotlin
    features related to object-oriented programming. You will learn about different
    types of class. We will also see features that improve readability: properties
    operator overloading and infix calls.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 5](text00125.html) *, Functions as First-Class Citizens* , covers
    Kotlin support for functional programming and functions as first-class citizens.
    We will take a closer look at lambdas, higher order functions, and function types.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 6](text00153.html) *, Generics Are Your Friends* , explores the subjects
    of generic classes, interfaces, and functions. We will take a closer look at the
    Kotlin generic type system.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 7](text00171.html) *, Extension Functions and Properties* , demonstrates
    how to add new behavior to an existing class without using inheritance. We will
    also discuss simpler ways to deal with collections and stream processing.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 8](text00205.html) *, Delegates* , shows how Kotlin simplifies class
    delegation due to built-in language support. We will see how to use it both by
    using built-in property delegates and by defining custom ones.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 9](text00222.html) , *Making Your Marvel Gallery Application* , utilizes
    most of the features discussed in the book and use it to build a fully functional
    Android application in Kotlin.'

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To test and use the code presented in this book, you need only Android Studio
    installed. [Chapter 1](text00021.html) , *Beginning your Kotlin Adventure* , explains
    how a new project can be started and how the examples presented here can be checked.
    It also describes how most of the code presented here can be tested without any
    program installed.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'To use this book, you should to be familiar with two areas:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You need to know Java and object-oriented programming concepts, including objects,
    classes, constructors, interfaces, methods, getters, setters, and generic types.
    So, if this area does not ring a bell, it will be difficult to fully understand
    the rest of this book. Start instead with an introductory Java book and return
    to this book afterward.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Though not mandatory, understanding the Android platform is much desirable because
    it will help you to understand the presented examples in more detail, and you’ll
    have deeper understanding the problems that are solved by Kotlin. If you are an
    Android developer with 6-12 months of experience or you have created few Android
    applications, you’ll be fine. On the other hand, if you feel comfortable with
    OOP concepts but your knowledge of Android platform is limited, you will probably
    still be OK for most of the book.
