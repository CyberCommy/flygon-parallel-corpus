    applications from the ground up. You will gain the fundamental skills you need
    in order to set up your environment, and we will explain what Xamarin is before
    we transition into Xamarin.Forms to really take advantage of truly native cross-platform
    code.'

    takes to create an app that you can build on and that stands the test of time.

    REST interfaces, real-time chat using SignalR, and location tracking using a device's
    GPS. There is also room for machine learning and the must-have to-do list.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book is for developers who know their way around C# and Visual Studio.
    You don't have to be a professional programmer, but you should have basic knowledge
    of object-oriented programming using .NET and C#. The typical reader would be
    someone who wants to explore how you can use Xamarin, and specifically Xamarin.Forms,
    to create applications using .NET and C#.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: No knowledge of Xamarin is required ahead of time, but it would be a great help
    if you've worked in traditional Xamarin and want to take the step toward Xamarin.Forms.

- en: '[Chapter 1](80b2455c-7174-4e4b-b2eb-916d03b9d3f6.xhtml), *Introduction to Xamarin*,
    explains the basic concepts of Xamarin and Xamarin.Forms. It helps you understand
    the building blocks of how to create a true cross-platform app. It''s the only
    theoretical chapter of the book and it will help you get started and set up your
    development environment.'

- en: '[Chapter 2](17d85c89-a26f-440a-9591-a859915936a8.xhtml), *Building Our First
    Xamarin.Forms App*, guides you through the concepts of Model-View-ViewModel and
    explains how to use Inversion of Control to simplify the creation of Views and
    ViewModels. We will create a to-do app that supports navigation, filtering, and
    the adding of to-do items to a list, and will also render a user interface that
    takes advantage of the powerful data-binding mechanisms in Xamarin.Forms.'

    with a Rich UX Using Animations*, lets you dive deeper into how to define a richer
    user interface with animations and content placement. It also covers the concept
    of custom controls to encapsulate the user interface into components that are
    self-contained.'

- en: '[Chapter 4](e7b8e522-ad16-4d1e-aab1-8c3ef6a342f8.xhtml), *Building a Location-Tracking
    App Using GPS and Maps*, taps into using geolocation data from the device''s GPS
    and how to plot this data on a layer on a map. It also explains how to use background
    services to keep tracking the location over a long period of time to create a
    heat map of where you spend your time.'

    App for Multiple Form Factors*, is all about consuming a third-party REST interface
    and displaying the data in a user-friendly way. We will hook up to a weather service
    to get the forecast for the current location you are in and display the results
    in a list.'

    for a Chat App Using Azure Services*, is the first of a two-part chapter in which
    we''ll set up as a chat app. This chapter explains how to use Azure Services to
    create a backend that exposes functionality through SignalR to set up a real-time
    communication channel between apps.'

    Chat Application*, follows on from the previous chapter and covers the frontend
    of the app, in this case, a Xamarin.Forms app that connects to the backend that
    relays messages between users. The chapter focuses on setting up SignalR on the
    client side and explains how to create a service model that abstracts this communication
    through messages and events.'

    Reality Game*, ties the two different AR APIs into a single UrhoSharp solution.
    Android uses ARCore to handle augmented reality, and iOS uses ARKit to do the
    same. We will drop down into platform-specific APIs through custom renderers and
    expose the result as a common API for the Xamarin.Forms app to consume.'

    Dog Using Machine Learning*, covers the creation of an app that uses machine learning
    to identify whether an image contains a hot dog or not.'

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We recommend that you read the first chapter to make sure that you are up to
    speed with the basic concepts of Xamarin in general. After that, you could pretty
    much pick any chapter you like to learn more about. Each chapter is standalone
    but the chapters are ordered by complexity; the further you are into the book,
    the more complex the app is.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The apps are adapted for real-world use but some parts are left out, such as
    proper error handling and analytics, since they are out of the scope of the book.
    You should, however, get a good grasp of the building blocks of how to create
    an app.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Having said that, it does help if you have been a C# and .NET developer for
    a while, since many of the concepts are not really app-specific but are good practice
    in general, such as Model-View-ViewModel and Inversion of Control.

    learning curve by focusing on what chapters interest you the most.
