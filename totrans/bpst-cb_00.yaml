- en: Burp Suite is a Java-based platform for testing the security of your web applications,
    and has been adopted widely by professional enterprise testers.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Burp Suite Cookbook contains recipes to tackle challenges in determining
    and exploring vulnerabilities in web applications. You will learn how to uncover
    security flaws with various test cases for complex environments. After you have
    configured Burp for your environment, you will use Burp tools such as Spider,
    Scanner, Intruder, Repeater, and Decoder, among others, to resolve specific problems
    faced by pentesters. You will also explore working with various modes of Burp
    and then perform operations on the web using the Burp CLI. Toward the end, you
    will cover recipes that target specific test scenarios and resolve them using
    best practices.

    target web application. We need to have a target which we are legally allowed
    to attack.

- en: <q class="calibre18">Know Your Enemy</q> is a saying derived from Sun Tzu's *The
    Art of War*. The application of this principle in penetration testing is the act
    of attacking a target. The purpose of the attack is to uncover weaknesses in a
    target which can then be exploited. Commonly referred to as ethical hacking, attacking
    legal targets assists companies to assess the level of risk in their web applications.

- en: More importantly, any penetration testing must be done with express, written
    permission. Attacking any website without this permission can result in litigation
    and possible incarceration. Thankfully, the information security community provides
    many purposefully vulnerable web applications to allow students to learn how to
    hack in a legal way.

    is considered the de facto standard in the industry for all things web security-related.
