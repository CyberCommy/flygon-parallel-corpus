    ethical and criminal activities. Remember, performing any intrusive actions using
    a computing system to cause harm to another person or organization is illegal.
    Therefore, penetration testers must follow a code of conduct to ensure that they
    always remain on the right side of the law at all times.

- en: Gaining written permission
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Before performing a penetration test on a target organization, ensure that you
    have **written permission** from the organization. If additional permission is
    required from other authorities, please ensure that you acquire all the legal
    permission documents. Having legal, written permission is like having a get-out-of-jail-free
    card as a penetration tester. The tasks performed by a penetration tester involve
    simulating a real-world cyber attack on a target organization; this means actually
    hacking into their network by any means possible. Some attacks can be very intrusive
    and may cause damage or network outages; the written permission is used to protect
    yourself legally.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Always be ethical** in all your actions as a professional in the industry.
    During your time practicing your penetration testing skills, I''m sure you will
    have realized that there is a fine line between being a malicious hacker and a
    penetration tester. The main difference is that the penetration tester obtains
    legal permission prior to performing any sort of attack and the objective is to
    help an organization to improve its security posture and decrease the attack surface
    that an actual hacker might exploit. Being ethical simply means doing the right
    thing and upholding moral principles.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Penetration testing contract
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As an upcoming professional in the industry, ensure that you have a properly
    written **penetration testing contract**, inclusive of **confidentiality** and
    **non-disclosure agreements** (**NDAs**), reviewed and verified by a lawyer. This
    is to ensure that client (target organization) information is protected and that
    you (the penetration tester) will not disclose any information about the client
    unless required by law. Additionally, the NDA builds trust between the client
    and you, the penetration tester, as many organizations do not want their vulnerabilities
    known to others.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If, during a business meeting with a new client, they ask about previous penetration
    tests you have conducted and customer information, do not disclose any details.
    This would contravene the NDA, which protects your customers and yourself and
    builds trust. However, you can simply outline to the new potential client what
    you can do for their organization, the types of test that can be conducted, and
    some of the tools that may be used during the testing phases.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Rules of engagement
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: During your business meeting with the client (target organization), ensure that
    both you and the client understand the RoE prior to the actual penetration test.
    The RoE is simply a document created by the service provider (penetration tester)
    that outlines what types of penetration test are to be conducted, as well as some
    other specifics. These include the area of the network to be tested, as well as
    the targets on the network, such as servers, networking devices, and workstations.
    To put it simply, the RoE defines the manner in which the penetration test should
    be conducted and indicate any boundaries in relation to the target organization.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Ensure that you have obtained key contact information for the person within
    the target organization in the event that there is an emergency. As a penetration
    tester, there may be a crisis and you may need to contact someone for assistance,
    such as if you are conducting your tests after working hours within a building.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: During a penetration test, if you discover any violations of human rights or
    illegal activities on targeted organization systems or networks, stop immediately
    and report it to the local authorities (the police). Should you discover a security
    breach in the network infrastructure, stop and report it to the person of authority
    within the organization and/or the local authorities. As a penetration tester,
    you need to have good morals and abide by the law; human rights and safety always
    come first, and all illegal activities are to be reported to the necessary authorities.

- en: Before running any penetration testing tools on a target organization's network,
    always test them within a lab environment to determine whether they use a lot
    of network bandwidth, as well as to determine the level of noise they create.
    If a tool uses a lot of bandwidth, it does not make sense to use the tool on a
    target organization whose network is slow. The tool may consume all the bandwidth
    on a network segment, causing a network choke point; this is bad.

    Vulnerability scanners can help an organization to meet compliance and standardization.
    Tools such as **Nessus** ([www.tenable.com](http://www.tenable.com)) and **Nexpose**
    ([www.rapid7.com](http://www.rapid7.com)) are reputable vulnerability scanners
    and management tools within the cybersecurity industry.
