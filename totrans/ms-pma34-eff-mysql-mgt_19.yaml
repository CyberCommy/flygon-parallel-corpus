    twice (as we cannot see what is entered) to confirm the intended password. A secure
    password should have more than eight characters, and should contain a mixture
    of uppercase and lowercase characters, digits, and special characters. Therefore,
    it's recommended to have phpMyAdmin generate a password—this is possible in JavaScript-enabled
    browsers. In the **Generate password** dialog, clicking on **Generate** button
    enters a random password (in clear text) on the screen and fills the **Password**
    and **Re-type** input fields with the generated password. At this point, we should
    note the password so that we can pass it on to the user.

- en: A frequent convention is to assign a user the rights to a database having the
    same name as this user. To accomplish this, the **Database for user** section
    offers the **Create database with same name and grant all privileges** radio button.
    Selecting this checkbox automates the process by creating both the database (if
    it does not already exist) and assigning the corresponding rights. Please note
    that, with this method, each user would be limited to one database (user `bill`,
    database `bill)`.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another possibility is to allow users to create databases that have the same
    prefix as their usernames. Therefore, the other choice **Grant all privileges
    on wildcard name (username\_%)** performs this function by assigning a wildcard
    privilege. With this in place, user `bill` could create the databases `bill_test,
    bill_2, bill_payroll`, and so on; phpMyAdmin does not pre-create the databases
    in this case.
