- en: Here, we'll cover what a device driver is, namespaces, **Linux Device Model**
    (**LDM**) basics, and the character device driver framework. We'll implement simple
    `misc` drivers (leveraging the kernel's `misc` framework). We'll set up communication
    between the user and kernel spaces (via various interfaces, such as `debugfs`, 
    `sysfs`, `netlink` sockets, and `ioctl`). You will learn how to work with hardware
    I/O memory on a peripheral chip, as well as understanding and working with hardware
    interrupts. You'll also learn how to use kernel features such as kernel-level
    timers, create kernel threads, and use workqueues.
