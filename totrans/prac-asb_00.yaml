- en: Welcome to *Practical Ansible 2*, your guide to going from beginner to proficient
    Ansible automation engineer in a matter of a few chapters. This book will provide
    you with the knowledge and skills required to perform your very first installation
    and automation tasks with Ansible, and take you on a journey from simple one-line
    automation commands that perform single tasks, all the way through to writing
    your own complex custom code to extend the functionality of Ansible, and even
    automate cloud and container infrastructures. Throughout the book, practical examples
    will be given for you to not just read about Ansible automation, but actually
    try it out for yourself and understand how the code works. You will then be well
    placed to automate your infrastructure with Ansible in a manner that is scalable,
    repeatable, and reliable.

- en: This book is for anyone who has IT tasks they want to automate, from mundane
    day-to-day housekeeping tasks to complex infrastructure-as-code-based deployments.
    It is intended to appeal to anyone with prior experience of Linux-based environments
    who wants to get up to speed quickly with Ansible automation, and to appeal to
    a wide range of individuals, from system administrators to DevOps engineers to
    architects looking at overall automation strategy. It will even serve hobbyists
    well. Basic proficiency in Linux system administration and maintenance tasks is
    assumed; however, no previous Ansible or automation experience is required.

- en: All the chapters of this book assume you have access to at least one Linux machine
    running a relatively recent Linux distribution. All examples in this book were
    tested on CentOS 7 and Ubuntu Server 18.04, but should work on just about any
    other mainstream distribution. You will require Ansible 2.9 installed on at least
    one test machine too – installation steps will be covered in the very first chapter.
    Later versions of Ansible should also work, though there may be some subtle differences,
    and you should refer to the release notes and porting guide for newer Ansible
    versions. The final chapter also takes you through the installation of AWX, but
    this assumes a Linux server with Ansible installed. Most examples demonstrate
    automation across more than one host, and if you have more Linux hosts available
    you will be able to get more out of the examples; however, they can be scaled
    up or down as you require. Having more hosts is not mandatory, but enables you
    to get more out of the book.
