- en: By reaching this point, you've done more than many aspiring developers ever
    will, and that's no small achievement. The most valuable asset you can cultivate
    in your journey as a VR creator is your persistence and your willingness to do
    the work. By finishing this book, you've already shown dedication and a desire
    to see things through that will set you apart from the rest. Take a moment to
    recognize this quality in yourself.

- en: You've probably spotted by now that our focus in writing this book differed
    from that of a lot of other tutorials. There's no shortage of material out there
    that will tell you what buttons to push, but here's the thing—knowing those things
    isn't how you become a good developer. You get good at this by learning how to
    think about the challenges you're trying to solve and how you can use the tools
    you have to solve them. To this end, we digressed multiple times into discussions
    of why something works the way it does or how else it could be used. Continue
    this thinking as you continue your own self-education. Taking the time to learn
    *why* will carry you much further than simply learning *what*. The latter could
    change with the next software update and usually won't apply to anything else.
    The underlying reasons we do things tend not to change. Train yourself to recognize
    that, to know a thing, you have to be able to describe why it is the way it is.
    We've tried throughout the course of this book to get you used to thinking about
    these *why* questions and to give you a number of tools to make more of these
    distinctions yourself.

    truth: **development is iterative**. Many of the examples we did together involved
    solving problems and changing our solutions as we discovered new problems or better
    ways of doing things. We tried, in doing this, to recreate the way developers
    really think as we solve problems. It''s a process that happens one step at a
    time. By focusing on the next steps, doing whatever work is required to do the
    next step, and not giving up or surrendering to discouragement when it''s not
    clear what those next steps should be, you can create nearly anything you imagine.'

    did, or why a problem you need to fix might be happening. Becoming an effective
    developer isn't a matter of memorizing a lot of things—it's a matter of building
    effective ways of thinking so you can find your way through the problems you need
    to solve.

    whose rules and vocabulary are still almost wholly unknown to us, and we're all
    in this together, learning what works and how we can help VR bloom into the art
    form we sense it's going to be. You'll be facing challenges that don't have known
    answers, because they simply haven't been solved yet. Maybe you'll be the first
    to discover them.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the years immediately following the release of the Oculus Rift and the HTC
    Vive, there was a flurry of activity and interest around VR, and then as the years
    wore on, that interest leveled out. Many people brought out their VR headsets
    for parties or demos and then put them away again—why?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Well, it happened for a few reasons.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The first was a question of technology, and here we need to be honest with ourselves
    that this is first-generation tech. What's actually going on to make these headsets
    work is astonishing, but they have limitations. This first generation of the technology
    was too expensive and too difficult to set up for mainstream consumers. The headsets
    weren't comfortable to wear for long periods of time, and the limitations of the
    lenses and the screens combined to break presence by reminding users of the technology
    they were using. Fields of view were narrow, lenses blurred the image if they
    were even a little bit misaligned, and low-screen resolutions left pixel boundaries
    visible (the dreaded *screen door* effect). The hardware developers knew this,
    but they also knew that the only way past the growing pains of a newly-emerging
    technology is to work through them.

- en: Think ahead a few years and you can see how these problems start going away
    in a big hurry. Screen resolutions are only going to keep improving, even as the
    screens get lighter and require less power. Optical waveguides are likely to replace
    the heavy Fresnel lenses we're using now and dramatically lighten the headsets
    and widen their field of view. External sensors are soon going to be a thing of
    the past, so setting up your VR headset won't require you to chew up three USB
    ports or mount base stations on your walls. Increasingly good standalone headsets
    and PC-based headsets that can communicate wirelessly with their base PCs will
    soon become the norm. These are very solvable problems, and it's reasonable to
    expect that they won't be significant concerns soon.

- en: 'Then there''s the question of simulator sickness. In the early years of the
    VR gold rush, developers tended to be utterly naive about this, or they became
    paranoid. Usually, the latter came as a response to the former. We all got our
    original DK1s and DK2s and immediately started making locomotion schemes just
    as we had on the flat screen, and we made ourselves sick. So, then we swung the
    pendulum in the other direction and teleported everywhere. Neither extreme is
    how it has to be. We''re learning more about what we can do to move the player''s
    view that works, and we encourage you to experiment with this as well. There are
    solutions that can work. The other reality is that people become acclimated to
    simulators, just as they do to being on a boat at sea. In the early 1990s, it
    was common for first-person shooters to induce motion sickness too. That doesn''t
    happen anymore, in part because the rendering tech improved, but also in part
    because players got used to them. A similar effect is happening with VR. Be conscious
    of simulator sickness and design your software to mitigate the effect, but don''t
    live in mortal fear of it: explore. Figure out what else can work. Early filmmakers
    had to figure out how they could get away with moving the camera and what cuts
    would work. This is the same thing. We''ll solve this challenge through experimentation.
    Frontiers aren''t places to be bound by rules. We don''t know them yet.'

    we can do with this technology. Anyone who tells you we *have* figured this out
    isn't using their imagination. We've barely gotten started.

- en: In the gold rush that followed the first release of the Rift and the Vive, developers
    for the most part treated this medium as an updated version of whatever medium
    they already knew. Movie people saw this as a 3D movie device. Games people saw
    it as an immersive gaming device. Neither really had it right.

    exciting place to play. We''ve advised you a few times to question those who try
    to tell you what you can''t do in VR, and here we want to take this a step further.
    Break those boundaries on purpose. Try things you know aren''t going to work,
    because one time in a hundred, they just might. Put active thought and imagination
    into the work you do in exploring VR. Let the medium show you how it works. We
    firmly believe that VR or some variant of it will be the defining medium of the
    21^(st) century. If you really think it through, it''s hard to argue convincingly
    any other way. The benefits of immersion and presence are just too pronounced.
    But we need to figure out how these things really work. We know a few of the basics,
    but we are far from knowing the whole. Early film viewers watching the Lumière
    brothers'' films of trains pulling into stations would have been hard-pressed
    to imagine anything even remotely approaching what films ultimately evolved into.
    Accept that this is the case here too. We''ve only begun to learn what we can
    do with this medium, and only barely begun to figure out how we can do it. The
    most exciting parts of this exploration lie ahead of us. Take a look at the following

    on this adventure. We wanted to give you a grounding in VR as a medium, but we
    also wanted to set you up to think about development and about Unreal Engine in
    ways that will empower you to do this exploration. We genuinely hope we've been
    able to be helpful regarding this. VR matters to us, as it obviously does to you
    too, or you wouldn't have made it through this book. Let's make some art.
