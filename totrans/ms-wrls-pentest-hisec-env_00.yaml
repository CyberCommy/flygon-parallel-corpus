- en: Wireless technology has become increasingly popular as it allows you to easily
    access the Internet from all sorts of locations around the world without requiring
    a network cable. But a wireless network isn't always secure if you don't understand
    its dangers, and especially if precautions are not taken. It is important to secure
    your wireless network for your own protection. Instances of identity and personal
    information theft has risen in the last several years.

- en: Even though it is easier to set up and connect to an unsecure wireless network,
    it is no longer safe as there is a greater risk of your personal data being stolen.
    It can be easily intercepted by another user with little to no experience. An
    unsecured wireless network is also another way for a user to monitor your online
    activity, such as your web surfing habits, chats, e-mail, and even your online
    banking account. While this book provides methods to protect wireless networks,
    it focuses heavily on how an attacker can break into a secured wireless network.
    It also demonstrates what an attacker can do once they have access to a wireless
    network.
