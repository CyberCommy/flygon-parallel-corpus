- en: The Raspberry Pi Zero is a powerful, low-cost, credit-card sized computer, which
    lends itself perfectly to begin the controller of sophisticated home automation
    devices. Using the available on-board interfaces, the Raspberry Pi Zero can be
    expanded to allow the connection of a virtually infinite number of security sensors
    and devices.

    including the networking applications of the Internet of Things, this is what
    we will see in this book: the integration of devices connected to the nodes using
    the amazing and important Arduino board, and how to integrate the Raspberry Pi
    Zero to control and monitor the devices from a central interface working as a
    hub. With software programming you will create an Internet of Things system based
    in developing technologies such as JavaScript, HTML5, and Node.js.'

    configured and will be able to use the Raspberry Pi Zero without any problems,
    so you can use it for the projects in this book. We will use some basic components,
    such as sensors, and move to more complex components in the rest of the book.
