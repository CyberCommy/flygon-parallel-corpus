- en: As one of the more versatile programming languages, Python is well known for
    its batteries-included philosophy, which includes a rich set of modules in its
    standard library; Tkinter is the library used to build desktop applications. Built
    over the Tk GUI toolkit, Tkinter is a common choice for rapid GUI development,
    and complex applications can benefit from the full capabilities of this library.
    This book covers all of your Tkinter and Python GUI development problems and solutions.

- en: '*Tkinter GUI Application Development Cookbook* starts with an overview of Tkinter
    classes and at the same time provides recipes for basic topics, such as layout
    patterns and event handling. Next, this book covers how to develop common GUI
    patterns, such as entering and saving data, navigating through menus and dialogs,
    and performing long-running actions in the background. You can then make your
    apps leverage network resources effectively and perform graphical operations on
    a canvas and related tasks such as detecting collisions between items. Finally,
    this book covers using themed widgets, an extension of Tk widgets that have a
    more native look and feel.'
