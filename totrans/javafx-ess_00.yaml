- en: This book, as its title (*JavaFX 8 Essentials*) suggests, is a pragmatic book
    that provides you with a robust set of essential skills that will guide you to
    become confident enough to rapidly build high-performance JavaFX 8 client applications.
    These applications take advantage of modern GPUs through hardware-accelerated
    graphics while delivering a compelling, complex, and fancy rich-client GUI for
    your customer, which will impress them quite a bit.

- en: Learning the JavaFX 8 essentials is the first step to plunging into creating
    applications that most importantly run on any platform, from the *desktop, Web,
    mobile, tablets*, to *embedded* devices such as *Arduino*, *Raspberry Pi*, and
    multi-core development. Following Java's *Write once, run anywhere* paradigm,
    JavaFX also preserves the same. Because JavaFX 8 is written totally from scratch
    in the Java language, you will feel at home.

    JavaFX 8 on Java 8 (yes, Java SE 8) so that the new APIs and language enhancements
    will help you become a more productive developer. Having said this, it will be
    handy (and I encourage you to go for this) to explore all of the new Java 8 capabilities.

    more frustrating than receiving complicated advice as a solution to a problem.
    Because of this, I have always made it a point to focus on the essentials. In
    order to render graphics on the JavaFX scene, you will need a basic application,
    scene, canvas, shapes, text, controls, and colors.'

    as a backbone to any future application. And finally, we will also explore some
    Java SE 8 features (such as Lambda, Streams, JavaFX Properties, and so on) to
    help increase code readability, quality, and productivity.

    wouldn't it be nice if you could change the UI of your application without altering
    its functionality? In this chapter, you will learn about theming and how to customize
    applications by applying various themes (look and feel) and the fundamentals of
    JavaFX CSS styling.
