- en: Up until a few years ago, direct DOM manipulation was the standard in frontend
    development, with jQuery leading the way. All that started changing with the popularization
    of modern JavaScript libraries and frameworks, mainly Angular and React. And then,
    in February of 2014, Vue came out with its initial release.

- en: With large IT companies backing both Angular and React, it was not clear how
    Vue would carve out its position. Initially developed by a single developer, Evan
    You, in four short years—and without corporate backing—Vue went from being the
    fun little project of a single developer to an unlikely rival to the big boys,
    with over 300 contributors. It's not a one-man show anymore.

    Adobe, Behance, Nintendo, Chess.com, and many others.

- en: Conclusion? Vue is here to stay. And while there might be an on-going discussion
    about whether it's better to learn Elm, or React, or Angular, or Ember, or something
    entirely different, this discussion is largely irrelevant. Each library and framework
    has something to offer, and in the end, it's simply a matter of trying it out
    and seeing whether it works for you.

- en: We developers need to embrace the necessity to surf the technology wave and
    accept that learning new frameworks and paradigms is simply a part of our careers.
    Therefore, the question is not whether we should learn Vue, or any other battle-tested
    and proven tech out there.

- en: Vue has already achieved its ranking, and it's playing in the same league with
    the big boys. The only question is, *How do I learn it efficiently?* and this
    book is an attempt to answer that question.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book is aimed at beginner-to-intermediate frontend web developers with
    no prior experience with Vue or other VDOM JavaScript libraries. It would be beneficial
    for readers to have some JavaScript and CSS knowledge. It is aimed at quickly
    bringing the reader up to speed regarding just how exactly Vue is set up and how
    its moving parts work together. It is meant to give you an overview of almost
    the entire Vue landscape, succinctly, and with lots of examples.

- en: The goal of this book is simple – to quickly and efficiently introduce you to
    Vue and to ease you into the framework without a major investment of time and
    energy. The intended result is for you to have a huge return on investment – to
    gain enough practical knowledge of the framework that by the time you've read
    the book, which should not take long, you are confident to tackle some more advanced
    Vue projects and concepts.

- en: '[Chapter 1](5fdb984c-98f5-4703-96ce-7bd3150fbe2f.xhtml), *Introducing Vue*,
    discusses what Vue is and gets started with mustache templates. We look at problems
    that Vue solves and reasons to use Vue.'

    Vue 2*, discusses reactivity, computed properties, and methods. We also introduce
    components, templates, props, watchers, and life cycle hooks.'

    Components, Props, and Slots*, shows how to install vue-cli and how to set up
    code editors to work with Vue more effectively. We inspect the structure of a
    vue-cli-based project, look at how to add basic functionality to a child component,
    and look at passing data from children to parent components.'

    describes how to use filters. We look at syntax, use cases, and some examples.
    We also examine working with mixins.'

    and Plugins*, looks at ways to extend Vue by making our own, custom directives.
    We also build our own plugin from scratch and learn how to publish it via npm.'

- en: '[Chapter 6](d8b6e8d0-8fa0-4787-beba-e1961d4c6a07.xhtml), *Transitions and Animations*,
    takes the reader step by step from comparing CSS transitions with CSS animation
    to understanding the differences between them and how to start integrating them
    with Vue. We then discuss a myriad of ways to organize transitions and animations
    in Vue—with transition and transition-group components, with transition hooks
    as CSS classes, with named transition hooks, and with JavaScript transition hooks.'

    the reader, from the ground up, just exactly what state is and why it''s important.
    It also explains the reasons to have the store – the centralized state – and how
    its internals work. We also tinker with some code examples of controlling our
    apps from this centralized store.'

    Vue-Router*, describes how SPAs work, what issues they have, and how these issues
    can be overcome with server-side rendering and code splitting. We then see how
    to build a very simple Nuxt.js app with a few pages, and some added transitions.'

    progresses, sometimes ES6 has sneaked in. The reason for using ES5 is because
    it is not assumed that the reader understands ES6 syntax. Likewise, it is not
    assumed that readers have not used it before—hence, a compromise was made: not
    to focus on the features of ES6, but not to completely disregard them either.
    It is the author''s humble opinion that this approach will shift the focus to
    where it matters: understanding Vue.'
