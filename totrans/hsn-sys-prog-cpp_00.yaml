- en: With this book, we aim to provide you with an understanding of Linux/Unix system
    programming, a reference manual on Linux system calls, and an insider's guide
    to writing smarter, faster code using C++. The book will explain the differences
    between POSIX standard functions and special services offered by modern C++.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book will also teach the reader about basic I/O operations, such as reading
    from, and writing to, files, advanced I/O interfaces, memory mappings, optimization
    techniques, thread concepts, multithreaded programming, POSIX threads, interfaces
    for allocating memory and optimizing memory access, basic and advanced signal
    interfaces, and their role on the system. This book will also explain clock management,
    including POSIX clocks and high-resolution timers. Finally, this book uses modern
    examples and references to provide up-to-date relevance to C++ and the wider community,
    including the Guideline Support Library and its role in system programming.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book is for beginner to advanced Linux and general UNIX programmers working
    with C++, or anyone looking for a general overview of Linux, C++17, and/or systems
    programming with POSIX, C, and C++. Although this book covers a lot of topics
    on modern C++, its focus is on system programming. It is expected that the reader
    already has a general familiarity with C and C++, as both will be leveraged throughout
    this book.
