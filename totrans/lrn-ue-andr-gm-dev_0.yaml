- en: The first Unreal Engine was launched in 1998 by Epic Games. A great feature
    about this engine was that, because of UnrealScript, the engine became quite popular
    with the community, as it made modding quite easy and accessible. Then, in 2002,
    Epic released their next engine, Unreal Engine 2, which was a great improvement
    over the first engine. It came with something called UnrealEd 2 (and later, UnrealEd
    3), which was essentially a level editor that you could use to create levels for
    Unreal. This, along with UnrealScript could be used to create entirely new games.
    The engine offered better rendering, better physics, and better collision than
    its predecessor. It also supported the then current generation consoles, namely
    PlayStation 2, Xbox, and GameCube. In 2006, Epic released their next, and, probably,
    their most popular and widely used engine, Unreal 3\. It was a giant leap in terms
    of technology. This is where Unreal Engine started picking up steam. However,
    perhaps the most significant feature offered by Unreal Engine 3 was Kismet. Kismet
    is an extremely powerful visual scripting tool. The way it works is that there
    are various nodes, which can be connected to form a logical sequence, kind of
    like a flowchart. The best part about Kismet is that you do not require any programming
    knowledge. You can make an entire game without writing a single line of code using
    Kismet. It is an extremely handy tool for artists and designers, since they can
    make quick prototypes or experiment with a certain feature on their own and not
    have to rely on programmers.

- en: We now come to a more present time. In February 2012, Epic unveiled Unreal 4,
    which was finally released on March 19, 2014\. Unreal Engine 4 had been in the
    works since 2003\. This Engine was a huge step up from the previous one. For one,
    it totally removed UnrealScript and replaced it with C++. In earlier versions
    of Unreal, if you wanted to modify the engine to develop your game, you had to
    do so using UnrealScript, which meant learning a new language. But now, if you
    wish to modify the Engine, you can do so with C++. This was a huge improvement
    for engine programmers, since this meant they could modify and tweak anything
    they wish using a language they already know and love.

- en: Not only that, the engine's source code is also available for developers and
    can be downloaded from the GitHub repository. This means that developers have
    full control over the engine and can tweak virtually anything, including the physics,
    rendering, and UI.

- en: It also offers something called the Hot Reload function. Normally, when you
    want to make changes in the code of a game, you have to stop the game, make the
    desired change, and then run it again to see how it affects the game. However,
    with the hot reload function, you can make changes in the game without having
    to stop or pause the game. Any change you make in the game's code is instantly
    updated and you can see its effect in real time.

- en: You can also develop games for a wide variety of platforms on Unreal 4, including
    Xbox One, PlayStation 4 (including Project Morpheus), Windows PC, Linux, Mac OS
    X, HTML 5, iOS, and Android. It also offers support for Oculus Rift.

- en: Another major change made by Epic is the licensing model, aimed at smaller,
    indie developers. To be more specific, to license Unreal Development Kit (UDK),
    which was the previous version of Unreal Engine, the developers had to pay a $99
    licensing fee and 25 percent of the royalties made after the company had earned
    at least $50,000 from sales. In Unreal 4, however, they have changed the structure.
    As of early 2015, Unreal Engine 4 is now completely free to download and use.
    No licensing fee, no subscription, nothing. You can download it, develop a game
    on it, and publish it, without spending a single penny on the engine. You only
    pay 5 percent of the royalties after you have earned more than $3000 in revenue.

- en: Another great feature that Unreal 4 provides is the Marketplace. The Marketplace
    is a great place to buy and upload assets. These assets can be Animations, 3D
    Models, Materials, Sound Effects, Premade Games, and so on. This is also good
    news for aspiring developers, who do not have the resources or manpower to develop
    these assets. They can simply buy the required assets from the Marketplace and
    use them in their game. Developers can also upload their own work onto the Marketplace
    and earn some money.

- en: This book is aimed at beginners who have little to no knowledge regarding Unreal
    Engine 4, and it covers how to develop games for Android using it. This book will
    cover all that you need to know in order to get started. From the very basics,
    such as how to download and install the engine, to the more advanced, such as
    how to upload your finished product on to the Google Play Store, are going to
    be covered. We will do this by making a game of our own using UE4, step-by-step.
    Each chapter can be thought of as a step in making our game. The book has been
    structured in such a way that each subsequent chapter is a continuation of the
    previous chapter to give a sense of flow to the readers.

- en: This book will also not use any other software (apart from the Android SDK),
    so that the readers do not have to first download dozens of software in order
    to get ready, and focus solely on the engine. All of the assets, such as materials,
    static meshes, and so on, will be the ones available in the Engine itself.
