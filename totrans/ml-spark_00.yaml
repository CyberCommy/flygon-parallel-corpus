- en: In recent years, the volume of data being collected, stored, and analyzed has
    exploded, in particular in relation to activity on the Web and mobile devices,
    as well as data from the physical world collected via sensor networks. While large-scale
    data storage, processing, analysis, and modeling were previously the domain of
    the largest institutions, such as Google, Yahoo!, Facebook, Twitter, and Salesforce,
    increasingly, many organizations are being faced with the challenge of how to
    handle a massive amount of data.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When faced with this quantity of data and the common requirement to utilize
    it in real time, human-powered systems quickly become infeasible. This has led
    to a rise in so-called big data and machine learning systems that learn from this
    data to make automated decisions.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In answer to the challenge of dealing with ever larger-scale data without any
    prohibitive cost, new open source technologies emerged at companies such as Google,
    Yahoo!, Amazon, and Facebook, which aimed at making it easier to handle massive
    data volumes by distributing data storage and computation across a cluster of
    computers.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The most widespread of these is Apache Hadoop, which made it significantly easier
    and cheaper to both store large amounts of data (via the Hadoop Distributed File
    System, or HDFS) and run computations on this data (via Hadoop MapReduce, a framework
    to perform computation tasks in parallel across many nodes in a computer cluster).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, MapReduce has some important shortcomings, including high overheads
    to launch each job and reliance on storing intermediate data and results of the
    computation to disk, both of which make Hadoop relatively ill-suited for use cases
    of an iterative or low-latency nature. Apache Spark is a new framework for distributed
    computing that is designed from the ground up to be optimized for low-latency
    tasks and to store intermediate data and results in memory, thus addressing some
    of the major drawbacks of the Hadoop framework. Spark provides a clean, functional,
    and easy-to-understand API to write applications, and is fully compatible with
    the Hadoop ecosystem.

- en: Furthermore, Spark provides native APIs in Scala, Java, Python, and R. The Scala
    and Python APIs allow all the benefits of the Scala or Python language, respectively,
    to be used directly in Spark applications, including using the relevant interpreter
    for real-time, interactive exploration. Spark itself now provides a toolkit (Spark
    MLlib in 1.6 and Spark ML in 2.0) of distributed machine learning and data mining
    models that is under heavy development and already contains high-quality, scalable,
    and efficient algorithms for many common machine learning tasks, some of which
    we will delve into in this book.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Applying machine learning techniques to massive datasets is challenging, primarily
    because most well-known machine learning algorithms are not designed for parallel
    architectures. In many cases, designing such algorithms is not an easy task. The
    nature of machine learning models is generally iterative, hence the strong appeal
    of Spark for this use case. While there are many competing frameworks for parallel
    computing, Spark is one of the few that combines speed, scalability, in-memory
    processing, and fault tolerance with ease of programming and a flexible, expressive,
    and powerful API design.

- en: Throughout this book, we will focus on real-world applications of machine learning
    technology. While we may briefly delve into some theoretical aspects of machine
    learning algorithms and required maths for machine learning, the book will generally
    take a practical, applied approach with a focus on using examples and code to
    illustrate how to effectively use the features of Spark and MLlib, as well as
    other well-known and freely available packages for machine learning and data analysis,
    to create a useful machine learning system.
