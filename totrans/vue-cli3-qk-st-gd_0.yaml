  zh: 前言
- en: 'Vue began as a project of a single person, Evan You. It is amazing that it
    has gotten to the point where it is today: a contender for the spot of the favorite
    frontend framework, competing with the corporate-backed React and Angular.'

  zh: Vue最初是由一个人Evan You发起的项目。令人惊讶的是，它已经发展到今天这个地步：成为最受欢迎的前端框架之一，与由公司支持的React和Angular竞争。
- en: Of course, these are not the only frontend frameworks, but the trio of Vue,
    React, and Angular seem to be the most popular, with the internet buzzing with
    comparisons of these frameworks and experiences with them. It's not uncommon to
    come across an article that compares Vue and React, for example, or a blog post
    on ten ways that Vue is better than Angular. Regardless of whether these articles
    are someone's opinion, or clickbait, or statement of the facts, there must be *some
    truth* to these claims.

  zh: 当然，这些并不是唯一的前端框架，但Vue、React和Angular这三者似乎是最受欢迎的，互联网上充斥着这些框架的比较和使用经验。比如，很常见的是看到一篇比较Vue和React的文章，或者一篇关于Vue比Angular更好的博客文章。无论这些文章是某人的观点，还是标题党，或者是事实陈述，这些说法肯定有一些真实性。
- en: 'What was the reason for Vue''s success? Dedication, hard work, or luck? Probably
    a bit of each. But another key to Vue''s success was Evan''s obvious priority
    of making things easy for the developer. Vue''s no longer developed by a single
    person, but it is still very approachable. The community has kept the gist of
    what Vue was all about from the beginning: an easy-to-use framework that gets
    out of your way and just lets you code.'

  zh: Vue成功的原因是什么？是奉献、努力工作还是运气？可能都有一点。但Vue成功的另一个关键是Evan明显地优先考虑了为开发人员简化事情。Vue不再是由一个人开发，但它仍然非常易于接近。社区一直保持着Vue从一开始就具有的要点：一个易于使用的框架，让你自由编码。
- en: Vue CLI is another example of this. Besides a command-line interface that's
    up to par with other modern frontend frameworks, Vue CLI 3 sets a new standard
    in frontend JavaScript frameworks, and comes with a **graphical user interface**
    (**GUI**). This interface makes it a breeze to set up, extend, run, and serve
    a Vue project.

  zh: Vue CLI就是这一成功的又一个例子。除了一个与其他现代前端框架相匹敌的命令行界面外，Vue CLI 3还在前端JavaScript框架中树立了新的标准，并配备了图形用户界面（GUI）。这个界面使得设置、扩展、运行和服务一个Vue项目变得轻而易举。
- en: When you pair this addition of a GUI with the successful attempt to ease the
    pain of toolchain fatigue by offering a really well thought-out setup process,
    you get a really powerful combination, and happy developers as a result.

  zh: 当你将这个GUI的添加与成功地试图通过提供一个经过深思熟虑的设置过程来减轻工具链疲劳的尝试相结合时，你会得到一个非常强大的组合，开发人员也会因此而感到高兴。

    more about Vue CLI 3\. The readers must have basic knowledge of HTML/CSS and JavaScript.
    Essentially, the reader should also be familiar with basic operational system
    workflow, such as using a UNIX-like command-line interface, including Git Bash,
    Windows PowerShell, or any related command-line tool.

  zh: 这本书是为网页开发人员和JavaScript开发人员准备的，他们想要更多地了解Vue CLI 3。读者必须具备HTML/CSS和JavaScript的基本知识。基本上，读者还应该熟悉基本的操作系统工作流程，比如使用类UNIX命令行界面，包括Git
    Bash、Windows PowerShell或任何相关的命令行工具。
- en: This book dives into the technological building blocks of Vue CLI 3\. This is
    not a book about writing apps in Vue. It is more of a foundational book that will
    help you understand how things work inside Vue CLI. If you were never completely
    sure how NPM works and how to use it properly, this book will explain that, through
    the lens of Vue CLI 3\. Similarly, we'll look at webpack, HMR, using single-file
    `.vue` components, SCSS, ECMAScript, unit testing with Jest, and E2E testing with
    Cypress.

    and what you''ll get out of using Vue CLI 3\. We''ll set up Node version manager

    3*, takes the reader through an overview of the evolution of JavaScript over the
    last several years, which lead to the appearance of webpack. In explains some
    background concepts: NPM and NPM scripts, CommonJS, modules in JS and Node.js,
    along with module bundlers and how they can be used in the browser. Further on,
    we cover webpack, how it works, and how to run it. We close off the chapter with
    a step-by-step explanation of how to add a Vue project via NPM and use webpack
    with it. Essentially, we''re setting up a Vue toolchain by hand, so that we can
    appreciate what Vue CLI 3 does for us automatically.'

    inspect the building blocks of Vue''s core Babel plugin, including `Babel 7`,
    `babel-loader`, and `@vue/babel-preset-app`. We also look at the differences between
    running webpack with ES5 and ES6, and updating our webpack configuration so that

    We add the Jest plugin to our Vue app, run unit tests with Jest, and show some
    additional techniques and workflows inside Vue CLI 3 GUI, including running tasks
    from the Project tasks page and running unit tests inside the GUI. We discuss
    **test-driven development** (**TDD**) and working with assertions, and close the

    Git Bash for Windows.  It would be beneficial to have some familiarity with Node,
    NPM, and some basic command line utilities, but this is not compulsory.
