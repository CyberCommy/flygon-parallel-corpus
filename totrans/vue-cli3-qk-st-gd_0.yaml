- en: 'Vue began as a project of a single person, Evan You. It is amazing that it
    has gotten to the point where it is today: a contender for the spot of the favorite
    frontend framework, competing with the corporate-backed React and Angular.'

- en: Of course, these are not the only frontend frameworks, but the trio of Vue,
    React, and Angular seem to be the most popular, with the internet buzzing with
    comparisons of these frameworks and experiences with them. It's not uncommon to
    come across an article that compares Vue and React, for example, or a blog post
    on ten ways that Vue is better than Angular. Regardless of whether these articles
    are someone's opinion, or clickbait, or statement of the facts, there must be *some
    truth* to these claims.

- en: 'What was the reason for Vue''s success? Dedication, hard work, or luck? Probably
    a bit of each. But another key to Vue''s success was Evan''s obvious priority
    of making things easy for the developer. Vue''s no longer developed by a single
    person, but it is still very approachable. The community has kept the gist of
    what Vue was all about from the beginning: an easy-to-use framework that gets
    out of your way and just lets you code.'

- en: Vue CLI is another example of this. Besides a command-line interface that's
    up to par with other modern frontend frameworks, Vue CLI 3 sets a new standard
    in frontend JavaScript frameworks, and comes with a **graphical user interface**
    (**GUI**). This interface makes it a breeze to set up, extend, run, and serve
    a Vue project.

- en: When you pair this addition of a GUI with the successful attempt to ease the
    pain of toolchain fatigue by offering a really well thought-out setup process,
    you get a really powerful combination, and happy developers as a result.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book is for web developers and JavaScript developers who want to learn
    more about Vue CLI 3\. The readers must have basic knowledge of HTML/CSS and JavaScript.
    Essentially, the reader should also be familiar with basic operational system
    workflow, such as using a UNIX-like command-line interface, including Git Bash,
    Windows PowerShell, or any related command-line tool.

- en: This book dives into the technological building blocks of Vue CLI 3\. This is
    not a book about writing apps in Vue. It is more of a foundational book that will
    help you understand how things work inside Vue CLI. If you were never completely
    sure how NPM works and how to use it properly, this book will explain that, through
    the lens of Vue CLI 3\. Similarly, we'll look at webpack, HMR, using single-file
    `.vue` components, SCSS, ECMAScript, unit testing with Jest, and E2E testing with
    Cypress.

    3*, explains how to use Vue CLI 3, and why you should use it. It covers best practices
    and what you''ll get out of using Vue CLI 3\. We''ll set up Node version manager
    and NPM, install Vue CLI 3, and show how to start a new app through the command
    line or with the help of the GUI.'

    3*, takes the reader through an overview of the evolution of JavaScript over the
    last several years, which lead to the appearance of webpack. In explains some
    background concepts: NPM and NPM scripts, CommonJS, modules in JS and Node.js,
    along with module bundlers and how they can be used in the browser. Further on,
    we cover webpack, how it works, and how to run it. We close off the chapter with
    a step-by-step explanation of how to add a Vue project via NPM and use webpack
    with it. Essentially, we''re setting up a Vue toolchain by hand, so that we can
    appreciate what Vue CLI 3 does for us automatically.'

    3*, examines how to work with Babel and what are the benefits of using it. We
    inspect the building blocks of Vue''s core Babel plugin, including `Babel 7`,
    `babel-loader`, and `@vue/babel-preset-app`. We also look at the differences between
    running webpack with ES5 and ES6, and updating our webpack configuration so that
    it understands Babel.'

    We add the Jest plugin to our Vue app, run unit tests with Jest, and show some
    additional techniques and workflows inside Vue CLI 3 GUI, including running tasks
    from the Project tasks page and running unit tests inside the GUI. We discuss
    **test-driven development** (**TDD**) and working with assertions, and close the
    chapter with an overview of Cypress.'

    and understanding vue-router topics. These include named routes, dynamic routes,
    navigating to routes using methods in Vue instances, working with child routes,
    and lazy-loading routes.'

    what additional features are available. We use a simple app we built in [Chapter
    5](e50a41d8-389a-4ecb-bf6d-7ad48c3c603b.xhtml), *Vue CLI 3 and Routing*, and we
    see how to improve its styling by adding the boostrap-vue plugin to the app. Working
    with SCSS in VDOM libraries can sometimes get confusing, and in this chapter,
    we see one possible workflow option in practice.'

    some basics, including tracking changes with Git and committing changes in our
    app. We continue by discussing the three trees concept, branching, and merging
    branches. We register a GitHub account, add the origin/master using GitHub Desktop,
    and look at how to publish a local repository. We finally discuss how to deploy
    a Vue app on GitHub pages using the *subtree* functionality.'

    Git Bash for Windows.  It would be beneficial to have some familiarity with Node,
