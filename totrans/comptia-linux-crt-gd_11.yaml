    First, we focused on scheduling processes using the `nice` command. Whenever the
    workload on your CPU is rising, various processes are contending for the CPU's
    resources; the niceness for each process was exposed using various commands, such
    as `ps` and `top`. After this, we moved on to the `renice` command, particularly
    dealing with processes that are currently running, and the method to change the
    niceness of running processes. Finally, we worked with processes in the context
    of foreground versus background.

    working within a GUI environment. We will look at the display managers that are
    prevalent in today's Linux distribution. Display managers are sometimes confused
    with desktops; a display manager manages the GUI login prompt, which is presented
    to the user upon boot up. Desktops are collections of X Windows which the users
    use to carry out various tasks. Some examples of desktops are XFCE KDE, GNOME,
    and Unity, to name a few. Moreover, the display managers that are on the current
    Linux+ exam objectives are covered. First, we will touch on the **X Display Manager**
    (**XDM**). Next, the **KDE Display Manager** (**KDM**) will be discussed. This
    is followed by the **GNOME Display Manager** (**GDM**). Finally, the chapter will
    cover the **Light Display Manager** (**Lightdm**).

- en: The XDM manages a collection of X servers. This could either be locally on the
    system or remotely on another X server on a network. The XDM utility is somewhat
    similar in nature to the older SysVinit, so you may be wondering about the concept
    of an X server. An X server is a program in the X Window system; it runs locally
    on the machine. It usually manages access to the graphics cards, displays, and
    interaction with the keyboard and mouse on the local machine. So what is an X
    Window system? Well, an X Window system , commonly called X, is an entire suite
    that is made up of a cross-platform, free client-server infrastructure for managing
    **graphical user interfaces** (**GUIs**) on a single or a range of computers,
    as is the case in networking environments. In the context of X, the way that the client/server
    works is a bit odd; an X server runs on each local machine. The X server then
    accesses X clients; X clients are GUI applications. Another interesting point
    to note is the fact the X clients can be running either locally or they can indeed
    be running remotely across a network. The X server acts as a middle man in the
    sense that the actual X clients interact with the X server; the X server then
    interacts with the actual display devices. An X server uses the **X Display Manager
    Control Protocol** (**XDMCP**). XDM was meant to be a graphical replacement for
    the command-line login prompt. After the user provides their login credentials,
    XDM initiates their X session.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this chapter, our focus was on display managers, particularly XDM, KDM, GDM,
    and Lightdm. Also, the differences between a display manager and a desktop were
    identified. We began by working with XDM in a CentOS system. We focused on the
    directory where XDM is stored. Added to this, we narrowed in on access control
    for XDM. Next, we switched our attention to KDM; KDM was dominant in Ubuntu distributions
    until it was later replaced. The methods of installing and configuring the system
    to use KDM were outlined. Following this, GDM was next on our agenda. We saw how
    GDM is being used practically in most Linux distributions. The difference in the
    name was highlighted when working in Ubuntu as opposed to a Fedora distro. The
    steps to installing GDM were illustrated. Moreover, we also covered installing
    some desktops within the mix; this proved to be quite simple. Then, the process
    to choose a desktop was also demonstrated. Lastly, Lightdm was covered. Lightdm
    is also popular in that it has replaced KDM in Ubuntu and was eventually replaced
    by GDM. The techniques to get Lightdm up and running were highlighted using a
    Fedora 28 distribution. The process of installing display managers and switching
    between display managers were the focal points to take away from this chapter.

    point, we have been working with various aspects within a Linux environment. Firstly,
    the process of managing user accounts (things such as user creation and deletion,
    directory modifications, setting a password, permissions, and ownership) will
    be the focus. Following this, the scope will be grouped. We will dive into the
    techniques used for managing groups, the process of creating and removing groups,
    assigning users to groups, and permissions, to name a few. I encourage you to
    join me once again in the upcoming chapter to be come better equipped for managing
    users and groups.
