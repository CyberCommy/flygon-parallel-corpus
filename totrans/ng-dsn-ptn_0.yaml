- en: Angular by Google is a framework for building web applications. It is a completely
    new product as compared to AngularJS.

- en: AngularJS was known to have performances issues, and it's not necessarily very
    easy to get started with. Everything could go well as long as you knew the very
    specifics and potential bottlenecks of the framework. In addition, AngularJS was
    often seen as a big toolbox, with a lot of tools inside, letting you build applications
    in many different ways, ending in various implementations of the same logic depending
    on the developer.

- en: Angular brings tremendous improvements performance-wise, while being a much
    simpler and straightforward framework to use. Angular simply allows you to do
    more with less.

- en: Google has announced from the start of the development of Angular that the framework
    would be a whole new product and wouldn’t be compatible with AngularJS, while
    they might try to offer some tools to ease the transition. Often, rewriting your
    application from scratch might be the best solution to migrate it. In that context,
    it will be necessary for the developer to learn the key parts of the Angular framework
    in order to bootstrap an application and the best practices to develop it as well
    as the existing tools to debug and benchmark the application.

- en: Taking a complete journey through the most valuable design patterns and providing
    clear guidance on how to effectively use them in Angular, this book gives you
    access to one of the best ways to learn Angular and use it to meet stability and
    quality required in today's web development.

    with a combination of case studies, design patterns to follow, and anti-patterns
    to avoid.

- en: By the end of the book, you will have learned about the various features of
    Angular and be able to apply well-known, industry-proven design patterns in your
    work.

    describes some of the best practices of the Typescript language. While Angular
    is compatible with other programming languages, in this book, we use Typescript.
    Typescript is powerful and expressive, but there are a few *gotchas *to avoid.'
