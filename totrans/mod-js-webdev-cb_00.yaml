- en: Since its origins more than 20 years ago, JavaScript has evolved from a basic
    language designed to enhance web pages by adding some interactivity to them, to
    a full language that has been used to develop quite large, modern websites of
    very high complexity, with highly interactive behaviors and fast response times,
    that successfully challenge classic desktop applications. Not only has JavaScript
    become *the* tool for web development, it has also occupied a place in server
    development, starting to edge out more conventional languages and frameworks such
    as PHP, Java, and .NET, since developers can also use their JavaScript knowledge
    when working with Node. Finally, two other areas, mobile application and desktop
    program development, both previously reserved for specific languages, have also
    become part of JavaScript's wide range of tools.

- en: Given this wide scope of JavaScript usage, in this book, we'll start by providing
    insights on the new features of the latest version of JavaScript, which can be
    applied everywhere, and also cover several modern tools that will help you with
    development. Then, we'll move on to using the language for specific areas, starting
    with the development of a services-based server, going on to create a web page
    that will use those services, then creating a mobile native version of the same
    web page, and ending up by producing a desktop executable program—each and every
    one of our products based on JavaScript and our set of tools.

    frameworks, and tools for building complete web applications, including server-
    and client-side code. A basic working knowledge of JavaScript is required, and
    you will be introduced to the latest version, dated June 2018, to keep up with
    the latest developments and functionality in the language.

    from there. Modern features of the language are explained, so we can develop code
    in the best way. Best practices for the language are also introduced and followed
    in all the code. Knowledge of HTML and CSS will also be required for the web and
    mobile applications.

    be done with a graphic interface.
