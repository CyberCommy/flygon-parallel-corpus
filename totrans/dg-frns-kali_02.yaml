    readers may already be familiar with the installation process, and perhaps even
    some of the advanced features such as partitioning and networking. For the beginners
    and those new to Kali Linux, we encourage you to pay particular attention to this
    chapter, as we begin from the absolute basics of downloading Kali Linux, working
    our way up to a successful installation.

    releases from versions one to five, Kali Linux was first seen in 2015 and released
    as Kali 1.0\. From 2016 onward, Kali was then named according to the year. For
    instance, at the time of writing this book, the version used was Kali 2017.2,
    released in September 2017.

    your instance of Kali Linux by using the `sudo apt-get update distro` command,
    demonstrated toward the end of this chapter.

    from the website of its creators, **Offensive Security**. The main reason for
    this being that the downloads of Kali on other pages could possibly be fake, or
    worse, infected with malware such as Trojans, rootkits, and even ransomware. Offensive
    Security has also included hashes of all versions of Kali downloads on their site,
    allowing users to compare the hash of their downloaded version of Kali with what
    was generated and posted by Offensive Security on their website ([https://www.kali.org](https://www.kali.org)).

    to Digital Forensics*, Kali Linux can be used as a live response operating system
    as well as a full operating system, installed and run from a hard disk. After
    downloading Kali Linux, the ISO image can be burnt to a DVD using any ISO file
    burning tool, such as ImgBurn. The DVD can then be used as a live OS, or it can
    also be used to install Kali to a hard disk. Tools such as UNetbootin can also
    be used to install Kali Linux to removable storage media, including a flash drive,
    SD card, or external hard disk drive, depending on the user's preference.

    a DVD and then install Kali onto a new hard drive, thereby catering to the concept
    of forensic readiness. In this instance, forensic readiness refers to the hard
    drive being brand new and untouched, therefore not compromised in any way, so
    as to maintain the integrity of both investigator and investigation.

    a brand new drive, there is also the option of installing Kali Linux within a
    virtual environment. Users can use virtualization technology such as VMware and
    VirtualBox to be able to run the Kali Linux OS as a guest machine within their
    host machine.

    the drive into logical drives. Think of it as having a large apartment studio
    comprising one large room. Now imagine that you've put up a wall to separate the
    apartment in half. It's still physically one apartment, but now it's separated
    into two rooms. One can be used as the main apartment and the other as storage,
    or you can even have two smaller apartments to share with yourself and a friend.
    Equally, a partition can allow for the installation of multiple operating systems
    on a hard disk, or even create additional volumes to use as storage space.

- en: We also looked in depth at installing Kali Linux in a virtual environment using
    VirtualBox. For beginners, I'd definitely recommend this method of installation,
    as it allows for trial and error within an isolated environment. Be sure to allocate
    enough RAM, and also remember that the 32-bit version of Kali only allows up to
    4 GB of RAM to be recognized and utilized. As a reminder, I once again suggest
    that you have access to both a Kali Linux live DVD and an installation of the
    OS, whether physical or virtual, to ensure that all bases are covered.

  zh: 我们还深入研究了在虚拟环境中使用VirtualBox安装Kali Linux。对于初学者，我绝对推荐这种安装方法，因为它允许在隔离的环境中进行试错。请确保分配足够的RAM，并且记住，Kali的32位版本只允许识别和利用高达4GB的RAM。作为提醒，我再次建议您同时拥有Kali
    Linux的Live DVD和OS的安装版本，无论是物理还是虚拟的，以确保所有情况都覆盖到。
- en: Understanding the forensics tools used in Kali is an excellent way to go about
    your investigations but we also need to understand the workings of storage media,
    file systems, data types, and locations. Join me in the next chapter, as we continue
    our journey into digital forensics by first understanding these fundamental concepts.
    See you in [Chapter 3](2c93f1cf-09d1-4817-b2a1-f3fda0c165c9.xhtml), *Understanding
    File Systems and Storage Media*.

  zh: 在Kali中使用的取证工具是进行调查的绝佳方式，但我们还需要了解存储介质、文件系统、数据类型和位置的工作原理。在下一章中，加入我，我们将首先了解这些基本概念，继续我们的数字取证之旅。在[第3章](2c93f1cf-09d1-4817-b2a1-f3fda0c165c9.xhtml)中见。
