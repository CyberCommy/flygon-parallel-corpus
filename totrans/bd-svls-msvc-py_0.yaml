- en: This book will give you a very good understanding of microservices and serverless
    computing, as well as their benefits and drawbacks compared to existing architectures.
    You will gain an appreciation for the power of deploying a full serverless stack,
    not only when you save money in terms of running costs, but also in terms of support
    maintenance and upgrading. This effectively allows your company to go to market
    a lot quicker with any new products, and beat your competitors in the process.
    You will also be able to create, test, and deploy a scalable, serverless microservice
    where the costs are paid per usage and not as per their up time. In addition,
    this will allow you to autoscale based on the number of requests, while security
    is natively built in and supported by AWS. So, now that we know what lies ahead,
    let's jump right into the book.
