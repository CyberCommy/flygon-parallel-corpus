    set up a kernel development workspace, build a Linux kernel from source, learn
    about the LKM framework, and write a "Hello, world" kernel module.

    drivers, performing I/O on peripheral chip memory and handling hardware interrupts.
    This book is primarily for Linux programmers beginning to find their way with
    device driver development. Linux device driver developers looking to overcome
    frequent and common kernel/driver development issues, as well as understand and
    learn to perform common driver tasks - the modern **Linux Device Model** (**LDM**)
    framework, user-kernel interfaces, performing peripheral I/O, handling hardware
    interrupts, dealing with concurrency and more - will benefit from this book. A
    basic understanding of Linux kernel internals (and common APIs), kernel module
    development and C programming is required.
