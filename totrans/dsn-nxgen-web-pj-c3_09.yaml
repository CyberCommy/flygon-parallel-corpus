    that uses text and visual effects to present something such as a product, a concept,
    or whatever. This project gives us the opportunity to explore some advanced animation
    and 3D topics and to extend our knowledge of Compass while creating some ad hoc
    functions to handle this complexity.

    do so, we first have to create an HTML structure to hold each of these elements,
    and then we have to find a clever way to obtain the desired effect. But, before
    doing anything else, we have to define the folder structure and initiate the essential
    files of the project.
