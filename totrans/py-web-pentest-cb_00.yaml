- en: Welcome to our book on Python and web application testing. Penetration testing
    is a massive field and the realms of Python are even bigger. We hope that our
    little book can help you make these enormous fields a little more manageable.
    If you're a Python guru, you can look for ideas to apply your craft to penetration
    testing, or if you are a newbie Pythonist with some penetration testing chops,
    then you're in luck, this book is also for you.
