- en: One can hardly develop new applications in our "now world" without duct-taping
    a lot of technologies together, be it new trend databases, messaging systems,
    or languages of all kinds. When talking about web development, things might get
    slightly more complicated as not only do you have to mix a lot of technologies
    together, but they must also work well with the applications accessing them (also
    known as web browsers). They should also be compatible with your deployment server,
    which is another story in itself!

- en: In the Python world, where people deliver amazing desktop software following
    great guidelines such as the Zen of Python and PEP8, we have, at our disposal,
    a wide range of libraries and frameworks for creating great web applications,
    each with its own philosophy. Django, for example, is a bundle solution; it makes
    choices for you on how your project should look, what should it have, and how
    things should be done. Web2py is another framework solution that goes beyond and
    bundles even the IDE with it. These are great concepts, but if you want to create
    something simple, I would suggest you to do it somewhere else. They're usually
    good choices, but sometimes they're just too much (the latest Django version seems
    decisive in changing that; let's keep an eye on further developments).

- en: Flask positions itself, not as a full-power out-of-the-box solution like both
    Django and Web2py, but as a minimalistic solution where you're given the bare
    minimum to work with and choose all the other stuff. That's very helpful when
    you want granular control of your application, when you want to precisely pick
    your components, or when your solution is simple (not simplistic, okay?).

- en: This book is a response to that scenario of beautiful code and many options
    in the Web world. It tries to walk through the main concerns regarding web development,
    from security to content delivery and from session management to REST services
    and CRUD. Important modern concepts such as overengineering, quality and the development
    process are covered, so as to achieve better results from day one. To make the
    learning process smooth, subjects are presented without rush and followed by commented
    examples. The book also sets out to give readers real-world advice on how to prevent
    common problems with code.

    a machine with Ubuntu 14.x or superior installed as the examples are designed
    for this setup, a basic knowledge of Python (if you don't have this, refer to
    [http://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/python/](http://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/python/)

- en: This book targets Python developers, with some or no experience with web development,
    who wish to create minimalistic web applications. It is focused on those who want
    to become web developers as all the basics are covered to some extent, and also
    on those who already are familiar with web development using other frameworks,
    be it Python-based frameworks such as Django, Bottle, or Pyramid, or frameworks
    from other languages.

    used to construct web pages, as is the case for CSS, JavaScript, and HTML. If
    that is not your background, please check out the W3Schools website ([http://w3schools.com/](http://w3schools.com/))
    as it covers the basics of using these technologies. Also, if you're skilled with
    the Linux terminal, your life will be much easier throughout the whole book; try
    the link [https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UsingTheTerminal](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UsingTheTerminal)
