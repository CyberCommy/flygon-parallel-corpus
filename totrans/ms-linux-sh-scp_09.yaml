    knowledge into practice. In [Chapter 8](part0056_split_000.html#1LCVG2-747571d9b4814e1dbffcdef2eb0dec8d
    "Chapter 8. Introducing sed"), *Introducing sed,* we became used to some of the
    capabilities of `sed`; however, this represents just a small amount of the power
    enclosed in the editor. In this chapter, we are going to exercise `sed` a little
    more and expose ourselves to some practical uses of the tool, especially when
    using our bash scripts.

    name-based Virtual Hosts. The Apache hosts are practical users of `sed` that we
    demonstrated but more importantly, we will use `sed` to search for selected lines
    in the main configuration. We will then uncomment those lines and save them as
    a template. Having created the template, we will create new configurations from
    it. The concept that we demonstrate with Apache can be applied in many different
    situations.

    and shell scripting. In this chapter, we are going to cover the following topics:'

    Apache 2.2 HTTPD Server taken from a CentOS 6.6 host. To be perfectly honest,
    we are far more interested in the configuration file, as Red Hat or CentOS supply
    it, than the actual configuration changes that we will make. Our purpose is to
    learn how we can extract data from the system-supplied file and create a template
    from it. We can apply this to Apache configuration files or any other text data
    file. It is the methodology, we are not looking at the actual result.

    screenshot shows the virtual host section of the file that we are interested in:'

    part of a monolithic `httpd.conf`. While creating Virtual Hosts, we normally preferred
    separate configurations for each of our potential Virtual Hosts. We need to be
    able to extract this data from the main file and at the same time uncomment it.
    We can then save this uncommented data as a template.
  prefs: []

    named `hosts` that we need to have running on one instance of Apache. This enables
    us to host `sales.example.com` and `marketing.example.com` on the single server.
    Both sales and marketing will have their own configuration and websites independent
    from each other. Additionally, it will also be very easy to add additional sites
    that we need with the template we create. It becomes the task of the main web
    server to read the incoming HTTP header requests to the server and direct them
    to the correct site based on the domain name used.

    and closing `VirtualHost` tags, uncomment it and save this to a template. This

    of the `httpd.conf` file and work with that locally in our home directory. This
    is a good practice while developing the scripts so as not to impact the working
    configuration. The `httpd.conf` file that I am working with should be able to
    be downloaded with other script resources referred to in the script from the publisher.
    Alternatively, you can copy it from your Enterprise Linux 6 host with Apache installed.
    Make sure that the `httpd.conf` file is copied to your home directory and that
    you are working in your home directory.

    definition that we saw in the earlier screenshot. This includes the opening and
    closing tag for the `VirtualHost` and everything in between. We can use line numbers
    for this; however, this probably will not be reliable, as we will need to assume
    that nothing has changed in the file for the line numbers to be consistent. For

    conveniently at the end of the file and we will have to scroll back to try and
    locate the correct lines number. To overcome these issues, instead of using line
    numbers we can implement a search for the opening and closing tags directly.

    to lines that begin with `#\/VirtualHost`, with the escaped forward slash.

    single `sed` command string, we can already see that it will be awkwardly long,
    difficult to read, and edit. Thankfully, the `sed` command does have the option
    to read its commands from an input file often known as a script. We use the `-f`
    option with `sed` to specify the file we want to read as our control. For more
