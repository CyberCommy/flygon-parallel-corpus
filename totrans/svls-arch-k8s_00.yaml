- en: Kubernetes has established itself as the standard platform for container management,
    orchestration, and deployment. By learning Kubernetes, you'll be able to design
    your own serverless architecture by implementing the **Function-as-a-service (FaaS)**
    model.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: After an accelerated, hands-on overview of the serverless architecture and various
    Kubernetes concepts, you'll cover a wide range of real-world development challenges
    faced by real-world developers and explore various techniques to overcome them.
    You'll learn how to create production-ready Kubernetes clusters and run serverless
    applications on them. You'll see how Kubernetes platforms and serverless frameworks
    such as Kubeless, Apache OpenWhisk, and OpenFaaS provide the tooling you need
    to develop serverless applications on Kubernetes. You'll also learn how to select
    the appropriate framework for your upcoming project.

    own serverless applications using the power and flexibility of Kubernetes.

- en: This book is for software developers and DevOps engineers who have basic or
    intermediate knowledge about Kubernetes and want to learn how to create serverless
    applications that run on Kubernetes. Those who want to design and create serverless
    applications running on the cloud, or on-premise Kubernetes clusters, will also
    find this book useful.

- en: This book provides examples of engaging projects that have a direct correlation
    to how serverless developers work in the real world with Kubernetes clusters.
    You'll build example applications and tackle programming challenges that'll prepare
    you for large, complex engineering problems. Each component is designed to engage
    and stimulate you so that you can retain and apply what you learn in a practical
    context with the maximum impact. By completing the book, you'll walk away feeling
    capable of tackling real-world serverless Kubernetes applications development.
