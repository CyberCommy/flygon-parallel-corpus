- en: Django is one of the most popular web frameworks in use today. It powers large
    websites, such as Pinterest, Instagram, Disqus, and NASA. With a few lines of
    code, you can rapidly build a functional and secure website that can scale to
    millions of users.

- en: This book attempts to share solutions to several common design problems faced
    by Django developers. Sometimes, there are several solutions but we often wonder
    whether there is a recommended approach. Experienced developers frequently use
    certain idioms while deliberately avoiding certain others.

- en: This book is a collection of such patterns and insights. It is organized into
    chapters each covering a key area of the framework, such as Models, or an aspect
    of web development, such as Debugging. The focus is on building clean, modular,
    and more maintainable code.

    versions. Django 1.7 comes loaded with exciting new features, such as built-in
    schema migrations and app reloading. Python 3.4 is the bleeding edge of the language
    with several new modules, such as asyncio. Both, both of which have been used
    here.

    are about building SuperBook—a social network of superheroes. As a novel way to
    present the challenges of a web development project, an exciting fictional narrative
    has been woven into each chapter in the form of story boxes.
