- en: This book is a practical guide that shows you the advantages of using Python
    for pentesting, with the help of detailed code examples. This book starts by exploring
    the basics of networking with Python and then proceeds to network and wireless
    pentesting, including information gathering and attacking. You will learn how
    to build honeypot traps. Later on, we delve into hacking the application layer,
    where we start by gathering information from a website, and then eventually move
    on to concepts related to website hacking, such as parameter tampering, DDOS,
    XSS, and SQL injection.
