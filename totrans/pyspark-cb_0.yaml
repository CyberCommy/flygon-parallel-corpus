- en: Apache Spark is an open source framework for efficient cluster computing with
    a strong interface for data parallelism and fault tolerance. This book presents
    effective and time-saving recipes for leveraging the power of Python and putting
    it to use in the Spark ecosystem.

- en: You'll start by learning about the Apache Spark architecture and seeing how
    to set up a Python environment for Spark. You'll then get familiar with the modules
    available in PySpark and start using them effortlessly. In addition to this, you'll
    discover how to abstract data with RDDs and DataFrames, and understand the streaming
    capabilities of PySpark. You'll then move on to using ML and MLlib in order to
    solve any problems related to the machine learning capabilities of PySpark, and
    you'll use GraphFrames to solve graph-processing problems. Finally, you will explore
    how to deploy your applications to the cloud using the spark-submit command.
