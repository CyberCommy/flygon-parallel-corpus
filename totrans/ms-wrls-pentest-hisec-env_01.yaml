    with data. Data can be accessed by anyone, especially by those who shouldn't.
    While this book may provide useful information to protect you, we cannot guarantee
    your safety. What administrators need to understand about potential security threats
    is that bad things can happen at any given time. If the cost to protect your data
    is too expensive for you or your employer, then it can be assumed that all of
    your data has no value.

    and the skills needed to get started with it. Then you will be able to comprehend
    the next few chapters with some fundamental knowledge already in mind. If you
    think you already have enough basic knowledge, it may be possible for you to skip
    this chapter. However, remember that if you do choose to skip, you may miss out
    on several key factors such as understanding Kali Linux and knowing which wireless
    cards to use. So, reading these sections will be well worth your time.

    customer data, and this will greatly affect the number of sales and ruin an organization's
    reputation. No one ever wants to lose the loyal customers that they have worked
    with and who are hard to gain and retain. Wireless penetration testing can help
    avoid these issues. The best benefit of wireless penetration testing is security
    awareness. It is very important to understand how hackers break into these networks
    and what they can do once they do have access. This is why "thinking like the
    hacker" can help prevent future attacks. You need to understand who your target
    is and what they could possibly be looking for on your system or network. Is the
    data valuable or not? Always ask yourself in the form of a "what if". For example,
    what if a hacker gets access to your online shopping account, could they purchase
    anything? What if a hacker got security clearance to your workplace, could they
    cause potential damage to your organization? These are only a few examples, but
    I'm sure that you get the idea.

    that most network administrators or information security specialists should be!
    Let's think about this for a few minutes. Imagine yourself as the IT administrator
    doing your daily tasks and duties. Then, to your great surprise, your wireless
    infrastructure goes down! Now this will depend on the business's production environment,
    but let's say that you work for a retail distributor and they rely on wireless
    communication constantly in the warehouse to pick and ship products. They use
    **Wired Equivalent Privacy** (**WEP**) encryption on two access points. You get
    notified about the situation and try to connect wirelessly to remotely access
    the wireless access point via HTTP protocol. It will not accept your login credentials.
    You begin to wonder what the heck is going on and then hear from other staff members
    that they cannot log in into their e-mail accounts or other personal accounts.
    You panic and sprint out to the warehouse to shut off the access points.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this example, the problem is that the organization was still using WEP encryption,
    which takes no longer than 6 minutes to crack and gain full access. A hacker could
    break this encryption, connect like a regular user, and then proceed by scanning
    the network, running a man-in-the-middle attack, or DNS-spoofing the network.
    The hacker could have many different user logins, including system admin logins
    to servers, and potentially gain access to the organization's credential information.
    Finally, the hacker could copy this information and sell it online or even to
    other business companies. This is why it is extremely important to keep everything
    up to date, including your wireless encryption algorithm. As of today's standards,
    it is recommended to use at least **Wi-Fi Protected Access** (**WPA**) encryption.
    In some cases, it does depend on the equipment and devices being used in the organization
    because not all devices support the newer encryptions, so they end up using WEP
    encryption throughout the entire organization. If you do use WEP, make sure you
    apply MAC filtering and log all activity within the wireless access point.

    This book will provide preventions against security penetration in just about

    Check the Aircrack-ng compatibility list to make sure that your wireless adapter
    has the necessary features to hack wireless networks. You'll need the ability
    to enter monitor mode (promiscuous) and inject and capture packets simultaneously.
    A wireless adapter that can't do both of these doesn't mean you can't crack wireless;
    the wireless adapter itself might be too slow to render. For a list of compatibility
    drivers, please visit [http://www.aircrack-ng.org/doku.php?id=compatibility_drivers](http://www.aircrack-ng.org/doku.php?id=compatibility_drivers).

    Kali Linux" or the comments from previous buyers should provide information on
    how well it works with Kali Linux. The reason why some of these products don't
    work well with Kali Linux is because it won't support the drivers. There are specific
    models out there on the market that will only work with Kali Linux. This is because
    Kali Linux only supports those specific models or versions. We will now discuss
    several models that I believe work the best with Kali Linux.

    and is extremely important to know when it comes to buying one to work with Kali
    Linux. It is also a good idea to find out what it supports. Will the hardware
    work okay with Windows and Mac OS X? Does the hardware support the latest Wireless

    to know whether your wireless card or access point will work with all platforms
    or just one operating system. If you use Windows and Linux operating systems,
    you will want to make sure that it will support it. Even if the wireless card
    is supported for Linux, it may not work with Kali Linux because we go back to
    having a chipset that is supported.

    you can buy. It gets excellent signal strength and is Plug and Play with Kali
    Linux. The only bad thing about this wireless adapter is that it has been reported
    as unstable because it can be unrecognized by Kali Linux, resulting in many trial
    and error reboots until it does work correctly. Overall, it is the best wireless
    adapter you will find for range, speed, and portability.
