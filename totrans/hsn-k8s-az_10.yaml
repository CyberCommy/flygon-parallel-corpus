    The applications were always self-contained, meaning the full application was
    able to be run in its entirety on top of AKS. There are certain advantages to
    running a full application on top of AKS. You gain application portability since
    you can move that application to any other Kubernetes cluster with little friction.
    You also have full control of the end-to-end application.

    to offloading parts of your application to one of the PaaS services that Azure
    offers. For example, by offloading your database to a managed PaaS service, you
    no longer need to take care of updating the database service, backups are automatically
    performed for you, and a lot of logging and monitoring is done out of the box.
