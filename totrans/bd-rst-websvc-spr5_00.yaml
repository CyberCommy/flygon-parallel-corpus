- en: REST is an architectural style that tackles the challenges of building scalable
    web services. In today's connected world, APIs have taken a central role on the
    web. APIs provide the fabric through which systems interact, and REST has become
    synonymous with APIs. The depth, breadth, and ease of use of Spring makes it one
    of the most attractive frameworks in the Java ecosystem. Marrying the two technologies
    is, therefore, a very natural choice.

- en: Starting from the basics of the philosophy behind REST, this book goes through
    the necessary steps to design and implement an enterprise-grade RESTful web service.
    Taking a practical approach, each chapter provides code samples that you can apply
    to your own circumstances. This second edition brings forth the power of the latest
    Spring 5.0 release, working with built-in MVC, as well as the frontend framework.
    You'll learn techniques to deal with security in Spring and discover how to implement
    unit and integration test strategies.

    RESTful web service, along with some scaling techniques using the new Spring Reactive
    libraries.
