    I want you to go through all the processes from start to launch. Web design is
    not just only designing aesthetic websites and beautiful layouts; web design is
    a whole process, especially when you want to implement your design to the real
    world afterward.

    first project is to design a website for a Racing Club; here''s the brief of the
    project:'

    with the client and asking them questions about their business and its goals.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is the right moment to identify the problem to be solved or to set a goal
    for the website. Sell tickets or increase ticket sales? See what your client wants
    and find the best solution for it. You also need to do your own investigation,
    dig into their website, and search for anything that needs to be fixed. With all
    the fundamentals we studied before, you're now able to see what is good and what
    is bad.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The best way to simplify the design process and the decision making is to know
    your target audience. There are plenty of ways to know your audience. You can
    either ask the client, track with different analytics, or check out previous reports
    on the same market that will help you in that phase.

    ages, incomes, and so on. Use these pieces of information to create personas,
    and create user flows that fit the website. In our example, the Racing Club, we
    would create personas such as the following:'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    of your website. Knowing what to show your users will set the design of your screens
    and plan the user experience.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You'll have to create a sitemap and define every screen you need to do. Doing
    this first will help you greatly in designing your website, as you won't even
    have to think about it.
  prefs: []

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Designing a website can be different when you need to follow a brand style guide.
    As the style guide will help keeping the consistency in the brand, the client
    will want you to follow it, even if it will restrict your creativity a bit.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    one for them.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Knowing a client's competitors is also a good way to know what to do and what
    not to do. In your process of gathering information, you'll need to research the
    client's competitors. It's not just about doing something totally different, but
    doing what is good for the client. If some user experiences of your competitors
    are good, take inspiration from them, to make your client's website better. You
    often don't need to re-invent the wheel, but just improve it.

    a project. It''s usual for projects to last longer than expected, but this should
    not be a problem, as it leads to more work. But, sometimes, clients'' expectations
    and your expectations are not the same, so it is best to set boundaries to prevent
    unexpected work and scope creep. Putting everything in a contract will help you.

    of the layout and content. So just use simple rectangles with your favorite design
    application, or you can even sketch it by hand.

    you might not have seen when designing it.

    sure every link is working. It's also a good way to practice placing your site
    on a staging website, where people can test it without launching it to the production
    server. You'll always find issues or mistakes throughout this process. Testing
    will make sure your website will work perfectly on each browser and each device.
    It's a long process, but it has to be done!

    some A/B testing to make your design even better, and never forget that a great
    website isn''t just about aesthetics, but finding the right balance between form

    projects. A lot of people rush into their project with design, but there are a

    taking some time by doing some research will actually save you a lot of time and
    money.
