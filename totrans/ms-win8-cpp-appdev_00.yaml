- en: Windows 8 is Microsoft's latest client operating system. On the one hand, it
    continues the trend of Windows 7, establishing a stable, robust, and modern operating
    system. On the other hand, however, it changes a lot of the assumptions and habits
    learnt from previous Windows versions.

- en: The ubiquitous Start button is gone from the Taskbar—and the desktop is no longer
    the first thing to see when a user logs in. A new Start Screen awaits the unsuspecting
    user, filled with "live tiles" that change their content periodically. The classic
    Start menu is nowhere to be found; curiously enough, the desktop can be found
    as one of the tiles in that Start Screen.

- en: The new look and feel of Windows 8 is obviously targeted at Tablet devices—numerous
    models have sprung up in recent months. The new user interface makes sense on
    a touch-based device, but the traditional mouse and keyboard setup still works
    as expected on a laptop or desktop machine.

- en: With this new Windows also comes a new runtime upon which a new kind of applications
    run—the Windows Runtime. Based on this new runtime, applications can be built
    and uploaded to the Windows Store—a repository of apps that received a certification,
    identifying them as safe and useful. In fact, average users can only obtain these
    new applications—Windows Store apps—through the Windows Store, rather than traditional
    installation means, such as installers or MSI files.

- en: The classic application, now dubbed Desktop apps, can still be written in the
    usual way with existing technologies in the native (Win32, COM, ATL, MFC, WTL,
    and so on) or managed space (WinForms, WPF, WCF, EF, and so on), and these run
    on Windows 8 much as they do on Windows 7—perhaps better, because of improvements
    in the Windows Kernel.

- en: 'The new Windows Store apps can only run on Windows 8 (and later) OS; they require
    that Windows Runtime, which is based on the well-established foundation of the
    **Component Object Model** (**COM**) technology. These apps look visually different
    in several respects: they are always full screen (except a special "snap view"),
    have no chrome, use a new UI design scheme, now called Modern UI, are touch oriented,
    and have some other not so obvious attributes.'

- en: This book is all about those new Windows Store apps. Starting with what they
    are, we will move through the various facets of the Windows Runtime, focusing
    on using C++ and the new extensions (C++/CX) to leverage this new runtime to write
    apps that can then be uploaded to the Store and shared with anyone running Windows
    8.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 1](ch01.html "Chapter 1. Introduction to Windows 8 Apps"), *Introduction
    to Windows 8 Apps*, introduces the Windows 8 operating system from the Windows
    Store app perspective and discusses some of the concepts around Windows Store
    apps and the Windows Runtime.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 2](ch02.html "Chapter 2. COM and C++ for Windows 8 Store Apps"), *COM
    and C++ for Windows 8 Store Apps*, introduces important features from C++ 11 and
    the new language extensions, C++/CX, that allow easier access to the Windows Runtime
    types. This chapter also discusses other classic technologies and where (if at
    all) they fit in the Windows Store apps model.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 3](ch03.html "Chapter 3. Building UI with XAML"), *Building UI with
    XAML*, shows how to build user interface for Windows Store apps by using the declarative
    XAML language and semantics. The concept of resources as they apply to WinRT are
    explained in detail.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 4](ch04.html "Chapter 4. Layout, Elements, and Controls"), *Layout,
    Elements, and Controls*, discusses the way controls are laid out to build a flexible
    user interface. Many elements provided by the Windows Runtime are discussed, paying
    special attention to groups of controls that share particular characteristics.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 5](ch05.html "Chapter 5. Data Binding"), *Data Binding*, discusses
    one of the most powerful WinRT features that allow seamless integration between
    controls and data. The popular **Model-View-ViewModel** (**MVVM**) pattern is
    introduced with examples of possible implementations.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 6](ch06.html "Chapter 6. Components, Templates, and Custom Elements"),
    *Components, Templates, and Custom Elements*, shows how to create reusable WinRT
    components that can be used by other languages, not just C++. Control templates
    are discussed, allowing complete change in a control''s appearance without affecting
    its behavior. Finally, the chapter demonstrates how to create custom controls,
    when some existing behavior is needed but unavailable in the built-in controls.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 7](ch07.html "Chapter 7. Applications, Tiles, Tasks, and Notifications"),
    *Applications, Tiles, Tasks, and Notifications*, looks at some of the special
    features of Windows Store apps, such as Live Tiles and the ways they can be updated
    locally and from a server. Background tasks are discussed, allowing code to execute
    even if the app is not in the foreground. The chapter also shows how to leverage
    the device lock screen, how to make long data transfers, and play background music.'

- en: '[Chapter 8](ch08.html "Chapter 8. Contracts and Extensions"), *Contracts and
    Extensions*, shows how Windows Store apps can integrate better with Windows and
    communicate with other applications by implementing contracts and extensions defined
    by Windows.'

- en: '[Chapter 9](ch09.html "Chapter 9. Packaging and the Windows Store"), *Packaging
    and the Windows Store*, looks at the procedure of packaging, testing, and deploying
    an application to the Windows Store, detailing some of the things to watch out
    for to get successfully certified.'
