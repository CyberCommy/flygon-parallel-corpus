    lot of information available; in fact, it is too much in some cases. It can be
    difficult to filter out the noise from the good stuff. Here we try to show you
    how to get what you need quickly and efficiently.

    to quickly find information on programs, utilities, functions, and other topics.
    The `man` utility will accept several options; however, the usual invocation is
    simply `man page`, where page actually refers to a topic. You can even run `man`
    by itself to learn how to use it.

    he or she is an expert on the subject when in fact, he or she is not. Many people
    also don't always check their solution before presenting it as a definitive answer
    to your question/problem. Be aware of this as you try solutions given on the Internet.

    options. Note that most just require a valid e-mail address to get subscribed

    one and then e-mail it to the group's e-mail address. People who are knowledgeable
    in that area are usually quick to provide help and will e-mail back to the group
    with a possible answer. In most cases, you can also search through the group's

    these chat rooms do so by joining channels that pertain to the subject they are
    interested in and are knowledgeable of. This is all done in real time as well
    with no need to wait for an e-mail reply to come back. You just need an IRC client,
    a server, and a group (channel) to join and (in most cases) are ready to go. There
    are quite a few different IRC clients. Some of these are text- mode (command line)
    and some are GUI-based.

    on my system is contained in the `/home/<user>/.irssi/config` file. You can override
    this using the previous settings. For now, let's just run it plain to see what
    it looks like.

    you with a welcome message since this is your first time in.

    screen. You may see something such as **[ Act: 2]** or equivalent. This indicates
    that there is new text present in another window, which you can access by pressing
    the *Alt* key followed by the number. So, *Alt* + *2* will get you to the next
    screen.'

    currently in the group. Remember that this is a public forum; be careful with
    what you say and follow the directions. Also take care to not put personal information
    in a chat session.

- en: There are so many Linux channels available that it is difficult to put them
    in a list. Some require authentication, while some let you start chatting right
    away. The best way to find these is to search the Internet for the subject you
    are looking for help on, and include the phrase IRC. Connect to the appropriate
    server, join the channel, follow any special directions there might be, and have
    fun chatting!

  zh: 有很多Linux频道可供选择，很难把它们列成一份清单。有些需要认证，而有些则可以立即开始聊天。找到它们的最佳方法是在互联网上搜索你需要帮助的主题，并包括短语IRC。连接到适当的服务器，加入频道，遵循可能存在的任何特殊指示，并享受聊天乐趣！
