    lot of information available; in fact, it is too much in some cases. It can be
    difficult to filter out the noise from the good stuff. Here we try to show you
    how to get what you need quickly and efficiently.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The `man` utility is an interface to the local reference manuals. It is used
    to quickly find information on programs, utilities, functions, and other topics.
    The `man` utility will accept several options; however, the usual invocation is
    simply `man page`, where page actually refers to a topic. You can even run `man`
    by itself to learn how to use it.

    to page down, and *Q* is used to quit. Pages (topics) are presented in a more

    `CONFIGURATION`, `DESCRIPTION`, `EXAMPLES`, `OVERVIEW`, `DEFAULTS`, `OPTIONS`,
    `EXIT STATUS`, `RETURN VALUE`, `ENVIRONMENT`, `FILES`, `VERSIONS`, `CONFORMING

    a wealth of data on just about everything in a Linux system. Unfortunately, they
    do have some drawbacks. Most are well-written and make sense. Some are, well,
    rather horrible. When this happens, there are other places to find help.

    These are accessed by using the `info` program. In general, the data provided
    by `Info` documents tend to go into more detail and are more informative than
    a typical `man` page.

    `AUTHOR`, `MAINTAINERS`, `INSTALLATION`, and so on.

    the information is not correct. The person giving the answer may act as though
    he or she is an expert on the subject when in fact, he or she is not. Many people
    also don't always check their solution before presenting it as a definitive answer
    to your question/problem. Be aware of this as you try solutions given on the Internet.

    one and then e-mail it to the group's e-mail address. People who are knowledgeable

    interested in and are knowledgeable of. This is all done in real time as well
    with no need to wait for an e-mail reply to come back. You just need an IRC client,
    a server, and a group (channel) to join and (in most cases) are ready to go. There
