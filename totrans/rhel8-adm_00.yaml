- en: Linux is everywhere, from personal devices to the largest supercomputers, from
    the computer labs at universities to Wall Street or the International Space Station,
    and even Mars! **Red Hat Enterprise Linux** (**RHEL** for short) is the Linux
    distribution most used in enterprise environments and knowing how to use it is
    a key skill for anyone in technology. No matter whether you are completely into
    managing infrastructure or you are a developer interested in knowing more about
    the platform you want to deploy on, learning about Linux – and, more precisely,
    about RHEL – will help you be more effective and could even boost your career.

- en: In this book, we cover the basic RHEL administration skills from a very practical
    perspective, providing examples and tips that we have learned from our experience
    in "the trenches." You will be able to follow it from beginning to end, being
    able to practice with each step while learning about how things are built and
    why they behave as they do.

    up, after reading it, with a strong foundation of RHEL administration skills.

- en: Anyone that aspires to build and work on IT infrastructures using Linux will
    benefit from this book as a reference for different useful tasks, tips, and best
    practices. It will help anyone seeking to pass the Red Hat Certified Systems Administrator
    (RHCSA) exam, although it will be no substitute for the official training, in
    which labs and specially crafted tests will be run during the whole process. The
    scope of the book is adjusted to the RHCSA, extending it with advice from real-world
    experience and many practical examples.
