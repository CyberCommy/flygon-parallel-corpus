    a look at the file recovery and data carving process using Foremost, Scalpel,
    and Bulk Extractor.

    their own filesystems to be able to store, access, and modify data. So too, storage
    media use filesystems to do the very same.

- en: Metadata, or data about data, helps the operating system identify the data.
    Metadata includes technical information, such as the creation and modification
    dates, and the file type of the data. This data makes it much easier to locate
    and index files.

    characteristics such as file structure and file headers, instead of traditional
    metadata created by, or associated with, filesystems.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As the name implies, **unallocated space** is an area of storage media that
    has been marked by the operating system or file table as empty or unallocated
    to any file or data. Although the location of, and information about, the files
    are not present and sometimes corrupted, there are still characteristics about
    the file that reside in its header and footer that can identify the file or even
    fragments of the file.
  id: totrans-5
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Even if a file extension has been changed or is missing altogether, file headers
    contain information that can identify the file type and attempt to carve the file
    by analyzing header and footer information. Data carving is quite a lengthy process
    and should be done using automated tools to save time. It also helps if the investigator
    has an idea of what file types they are looking for, to have a better focus and
    to save time. Nevertheless, this is forensics and we know that time and patience
    are key.

    for choosing this particular image for this exercise is that Nick Mikus is listed
    as one of the contributing developers of Foremost. As seen in the first line of
    Foremost, which displays the version number alongside authors Jesse Kornblum and

    have a look at the many others available at [http://digitalcorpora.org/](http://digitalcorpora.org/)
    and see what `bulk_extractor` reveals. Try downloading as many of the images as
    possible if your bandwidth and storage permit, and also use the other tools we'll
    use in other chapters.

- en: In this chapter, we learned about file recovery and data extraction using three
    readily-available tools within Kali Linux. We first performed file carving using
    the very impressive Foremost, which searched the entire image for supported file
    types within the file header and footers. We then did the same using the newer
    Scalpel, but had to make a slight modification by selecting the file types we
    wished to carve. Both Foremost and Scalpel presented us with an `audit.txt` file
    summarizing the carve list and its details along with subfolders containing the
    actual evidence.

- en: Bulk_extractor is a wonderful tool that carves data and also finds useful information
    such as email addresses, visited URLs, Facebook URLs, credit card numbers, and
    a variety of other information. Bulk_extractor is great for investigations requiring
    file recovery and carving, together with either Foremost or Scalpel, or even both.

  zh: Bulk_extractor是一个很棒的工具，它可以刻录数据，还可以找到诸如电子邮件地址、访问的URL、Facebook的URL、信用卡号码以及各种其他信息。Bulk_extractor非常适合需要文件恢复和刻录的调查，可以与Foremost或Scalpel一起使用，甚至两者都可以。

    more analytical. In the next chapter, we'll take a look at exploring RAM and the
    paging file as part of memory forensics, using the very powerful volatility. See
    you there!
