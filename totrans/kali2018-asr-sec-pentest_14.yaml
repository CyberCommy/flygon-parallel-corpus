- en: Assessment tracking and documentation is a critical aspect of professional penetration
    testing. Each input and output from the testing tools should be recorded to ensure
    that the findings are reproducible in an accurate and consistent manner when needed.
    Keep in mind that part of the penetration testing process includes presenting
    the findings to clients. There is a high likelihood that these clients will want
    to mitigate the vulnerabilities and then attempt to mimic your steps in order
    to ensure their mitigations were effective. Depending on the scope, you may be
    required to perform additional testing that verifies that any improvements that
    the client makes actually remove the vulnerabilities you found. Accurate documentation
    of your steps will assist you in ensuring that the very same testing occurs during
    this follow-up.

- en: Proper test documentation provides a record of the actions performed and thus
    allows you to trace your steps in case the client experiences non-test related
    incidents during your agreed-upon test window. Detailed recording of your actions
    can be very tedious, but as a professional penetration tester, you should not
    overlook this step.

    a small mistake can lead to a legal problem. The report that you create must show
    consistency with your findings, and should do more than just point out the potential
    weaknesses found in a target environment. For instance, it should be well prepared
    and demonstrate a proof of support against known compliance requirements, if any,
    required by your client. Additionally, it should clearly state the attacker's
    modus operandi, applied tools, and techniques, and list the discovered vulnerabilities
    and verified exploitation methods. Primarily, it is about focusing on the weaknesses,
    rather than explaining the fact or procedure used to discover them.

    cases, to ensure that your findings are actually exploitable. Mitigation efforts
    can be expensive and, as such, vulnerability verification is a critical task in
    terms of your reputation and integrity. In our experience, we have noticed several
    situations where people just run a tool, grab the results, and present them directly
    to their clients. This type of irresponsibility and lack of control over your
    assessment may result in serious consequences and lead to the downfall of your
    career. In situations where there are false negatives, it might even place the
    client at risk by selling a false sense of security. Thus, the integrity of test
    data should not be tainted with errors and inconsistencies.

    to repeat the exercise at least twice before drawing a final conclusion from a
    particular tool. In this way, you certify and test-proof your results against
    any unforeseen conditions. For instance, when using Nmap for the purpose of port
    scanning, we should lay out our template with any necessary sections, such as
    usage purpose, target host, execution options, and profiles (service detection,
    OS type, MAC address, open ports, device type, and so on), and document the output

    This will ensure the transparency of the verification process, increased productivity,
    and reduced false positives and false negatives. In other words, every tool has
    its own specialty for handling a particular situation. It is also worth testing
    certain conditions manually wherever applicable, and using your knowledge and

- en: Faraday IDE is another tool built to support collaboration while utilizing approximately
    40 built-in tools for generating reports. Supported plugins include those for
    Metasploit, Nmap, and Nessus. Faraday IDE brings forth the concept of multi-user
    penetration testing in an environment that functions exactly the same as it would
    if running the tools individually within the Terminal.

- en: In this chapter, we explored some of the basic steps necessary for creating
    a penetration testing report and discussed the core aspects of holding a presentation
    in front of the client. At first, we fully explained the methods of documenting
    your results from individual tools and suggested that you don't rely on single
    tools for your final results. As such, your experience and knowledge count in
    verifying the test results before they are documented. Make sure to keep your
    skills updated and sufficient to manually verify the findings when needed.

    while touching on Faraday IDE and MagicTree. We encourage you to try them all
    as you may wish to combine the tools for various purposes and collaborations.
