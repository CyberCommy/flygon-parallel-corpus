- en: The React framework from Facebook redefines the way frontend applications should
    be built. React Router has become the de-facto routing framework for applications
    built with React. With its latest version 4 release, the library has been rewritten
    in React and it lets you handle routing declaratively. In this book, you'll learn
    how the react-router library can be used in any React application, including web
    and native mobile applications developed with React Native. The book also covers
    topics such as server-side routing and Redux integration with React Router.
