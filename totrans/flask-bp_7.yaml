    URL-encoded (meaning that non-URL safe values are specially encoded to ensure
    they are transmitted correctly). Once the key/value pairs have been encoded, they
    must then be sorted lexicographically by key (remember, the encoded key and not
    the raw key value) and then concatenated to a single string using typical URL
    parameter separators. Additionally, the HTTP verb that is to be used to submit
    the request (for example, `GET` or `POST`) must be prepended to the string that
    we just created and then followed by the URL that the request will be sent to.
    Finally, the signing key is to be constructed from the consumer secret key and
    an OAuth token secret and then passed to an implementation of the HMAC-SHA1 hashing
    algorithm along with the payload that we constructed earlier.
