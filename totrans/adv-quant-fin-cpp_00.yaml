- en: Quantitative Finance is a highly complex interdisciplinary field, which covers
    mathematics, finance, and information technology. Navigating it successfully requires
    specialist knowledge from many sources, such as financial derivatives, stochastic
    calculus, and Monte Carlo simulation. Crucially, it also requires a hands-on ability
    to transform theory into practice effectively.

- en: In *Advanced Quantitative Finance with C++*, we provide a guided tour through
    this exciting field. The key mathematical models used to price financial derivatives
    are explained as well as the main numerical models used to solve them. In particular,
    equity, currency, interest rates, and credit derivatives are discussed. The book
    also presents how to implement these models in C++ step by step. Several fully
    working, complete examples are given that can be immediately tested by the reader
    to support and complement their learning.

- en: In order to implement the pricing algorithms described in this book, you will
    need some basic knowledge of C++ and Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
    of your choice. I have used Code:Blocks, which is a free C, C++, and Fortran IDE,
    and is highly extensible and fully configurable. You can download it from [http://www.codeblocks.org/](http://www.codeblocks.org/).
    You will also need a C++ compiler. I have used MinGW, which is a part of the GNU
    Compiler Collection (GCC), including C, C++, ADA, and Fortran compilers. This
    compiler can be downloaded from [http://www.mingw.org/](http://www.mingw.org/).

    other professionals working in the field of Quantitative Finance who want a quick
    reference or a hands-on introduction to pricing of financial derivatives. Postgraduate,
    MSc, and MBA students following university courses on derivatives in corporate
    finance and/or risk management will also benefit from this book. It could be used
    effectively by advanced undergraduate students who are interested in understanding
    these fascinating financial instruments. A basic familiarity with programming
    concepts, C++ programming language, and undergraduate-level calculus is required.
