- en: Quantitative Finance is a highly complex interdisciplinary field, which covers
    mathematics, finance, and information technology. Navigating it successfully requires
    specialist knowledge from many sources, such as financial derivatives, stochastic
    calculus, and Monte Carlo simulation. Crucially, it also requires a hands-on ability
    to transform theory into practice effectively.

- en: In *Advanced Quantitative Finance with C++*, we provide a guided tour through
    this exciting field. The key mathematical models used to price financial derivatives
    are explained as well as the main numerical models used to solve them. In particular,
    equity, currency, interest rates, and credit derivatives are discussed. The book
    also presents how to implement these models in C++ step by step. Several fully
    working, complete examples are given that can be immediately tested by the reader
    to support and complement their learning.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In order to implement the pricing algorithms described in this book, you will
    need some basic knowledge of C++ and Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
    of your choice. I have used Code:Blocks, which is a free C, C++, and Fortran IDE,
    and is highly extensible and fully configurable. You can download it from [http://www.codeblocks.org/](http://www.codeblocks.org/).
    You will also need a C++ compiler. I have used MinGW, which is a part of the GNU
    Compiler Collection (GCC), including C, C++, ADA, and Fortran compilers. This
    compiler can be downloaded from [http://www.mingw.org/](http://www.mingw.org/).
