- en: The penetration testing technology today is riddled with oversimplified Graphical
    User Interfaces. Though easy to use, they often offer very little control over
    the operations they perform and don't offer a very informative experience to their
    users. Another drawback is that many of these security assessment solutions are
    only developed to identify and automate exploitation for the most obvious and
    unobfuscated instances of vulnerabilities. For every other practical instance
    of a vulnerability, penetration testers need to rely on their own scripts and
    assessment tools.

- en: The basic skill set of a good penetration tester includes at least rudimentary
    skills in a scripting or software development languages such as bash scripting,
    Python, Go, Ruby, and so on. This is so that they can handle the weird and outlier
    instances of vulnerabilities with their own customized tools and are capable of
    automating security testing according to their own terms. Firewalls, intrusion
    detection/prevention systems, and other security monitoring solutions are becoming
    smarter, and the only way we, as penetration testers, are ever going to beat them
    is by learning to build our own tools to "weaponize" our command lines.

- en: This book introduces some of the fundamental skills, tips, tricks, and command-line-driven
    utilities that the best penetration testers from all across the world use to ensure
    that they have as much control over their testing activities as possible. Anyone
    interested in introducing themselves to the command line specifically for penetration
    testing or penetration testing as a whole, will benefit from reading this book.

    Bash*, introduces readers to the fundamental concepts involved in using the bash
    terminal. It covers utilities that readers will find helpful in their day-to-day
    activities as penetration testers, system administrators, and security-orientated
    developers.'

    Shell*, focuses on tips and tricks that readers can use to customize the behavior
    of the shells to suit their needs. It shows readers how to customize the cursor
    to format text, how to control command history securely, how to use aliases, and
    how to enable tab completion to make command-line utilities more user-friendly
    and easy to use.'

    covers command-line utilities that readers can use to perform target enumeration
    and exfilterate information from common network services. This chapter introduces
    numerous tools, including Dnsmap, Nmap, and Whois among others, as well as useful
    ways to integrate these tools with the other command-line tools.'

    *Exploitation and Reverse Engineering*, focuses on demonstrating and discussing
    the fundamental reverse engineering and host-based exploitation command-line driven
    tools. The chapter covers tools such as msfcli, msfpayload, GNU gdb, and various
    techniques, and shows how readers can combine these tools in useful ways with
    the help of bash scripting.'

    Exploitation and Monitoring*, shifts the focus to network exploitation tools and
    the utilities that the readers will likely use in their day-to-day penetration
    tests. The chapter covers tools such as ARPSpoof, Ettercap, and SSLyze, and also
    introduces readers to useful bash scripts and commands that optimize the usage
    of these commands and automates many common tasks.'
