    of the chapters in this book. Qt consists of two different methods for developing
    an application. The first method is Qt Widgets and C++, which we have covered
    in all previous chapters. The second method is using Qt Quick controls and the
    QML scripting language, which we will be covering in this chapter.

    engines and language infrastructure for developing touch-oriented and visual-oriented
    applications. Instead of using the usual Qt Widgets for user-interface design,
    developers who choose Qt Quick will be using the Qt Quick objects and controls
    instead.'

    has similar syntax to **JavaScript**, rather than writing in C++ code. You can,
    however, use the C++ API provided by Qt to extend the QML application by cross-calling
    each language's functions (calling C++ functions in QML, and vice versa).

    designing touch-friendly user interfaces, similar to how CSS works on HTML. Unlike
    C++ or JavaScript, which are both imperative languages, QML is a declarative language.
    In declarative programming, you only express the logic in your script without
    describing its control flow. It simply tells the computer what to do, instead
    of how to do it. Imperative programing, however, requires statements to specify

    extension `.qml`, and another with extension `.ui.qml`. Even though they are both
    running on the same syntax and so forth, they serve a very different purpose in
    your project.
  id: totrans-25

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: First, the `.ui.qml` file (with an extra .`ui` at the beginning) serves as the
    declarative file for Qt Quick-based user interface design. You can edit a `.ui.qml`
    file, using the Qt Quick Designer visual editor, and easily design your application's
    GUI. You can also add your own code to the file, but there are some limitations
    on what code they can contain, especially those related to logic code. When you
    run your Qt Quick application, the Qt Quick engine will read through all the information
    stored in the `.ui.qml` file and construct the user interface accordingly, which
    is very similar to the `.ui` file used in Qt Widgets applications.
  id: totrans-26
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Then, we have another file with only the `.qml` extension. This file is only
    used for constructing the logic and functionality in your Qt Quick application,
    much like the `.h` and `.cpp` files used in the Qt Widget application. These two
    different formats separate the visual definitions of your application from its
    logic blocks. This allows the developer to apply the same logic code to different
    user interface templates. You cannot open a `.qml` file using Qt Quick Designer,
    since it is not used for GUI declaration. `.qml` files are written by developers
    by hand, and they have no restrictions on the QML language features they use.

    the appropriate version number. Different Qt Quick versions may have different
    functionalities, and support different widget controls. Sometimes, even the syntax
    could be slightly different. Please make sure you pick the right version for your

    the `QtQuick.Window` module. After setting the properties of the `Window` type,
    the `MainForm` type is declared. This `MainForm` type is actually the entire user
    interface  we saw previously in `MainForm.ui.qml`. Since the `MouseArea` and `TextEdit` types
    have been exposed in `MainForm.ui.qml`, we can now access and make use of them
    in `main.qml`.

- en: QML also uses the signal-and-slot mechanism provided by Qt, but in a slightly
    different form of writing, since we're no longer writing C++ code. For example,
    we can see `onClicked` being used in the code above, which is a built-in signal
    equivalent to `clicked()` in a Qt Widgets Application. Since the `.qml` file is
    the place where we define the application logic, we can define what happens when
    `onClicked` is being called. On the other hand, we cannot do the same in `.ui.qml` since
    only visual-related code is allowed in it. You will get warnings from Qt Creator
    if you try to write logic-related code in a `.ui.qml` file.

    code doesn't get compiled into binary by default. QML is an interpreted language,
    just like JavaScript, and thus it doesn't need to be compiled in order for it
    to be executed. All the QML files will just get packed into your application's
    resource system during the build process. Then, the QML files will be loaded and
    interpreted by the Qt Quick engine once the application is started.
  id: totrans-45

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    the `Qt Quick Compiler` program included in Qt, to make the code execution slightly
    faster than usual. It is an optional step that is not required unless you are
    trying to run your application on an embedded system that has very limited resources.

    is unable to open the images, please go back to your `MainForm.ui.qml` and add
    in the prefix `image/` to the front of the source property. This is because Qt
    Quick Designer loads the images without the prefix, while your final program needs
    the prefix. After you have added the prefix, you may realize you no longer see
    the images getting displayed on Qt Quick Designer, but it will work just fine
    in your final program.

  zh: 如果您没有看到图片，并且收到错误消息说Qt无法打开图片，请返回到您的`MainForm.ui.qml`，并在源属性的前面添加前缀`image/`。这是因为Qt
    Quick Designer加载图片时没有前缀，而您的最终程序需要前缀。添加了前缀后，您可能会意识到在Qt Quick Designer中不再看到图片显示，但在最终程序中将正常工作。

    developers can get it fixed, and we won't have to do that extra step anymore.
