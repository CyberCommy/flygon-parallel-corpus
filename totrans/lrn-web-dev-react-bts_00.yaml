- en: We all know that JavaScript applications are the future of web development,
    and there are many different frameworks available to build isomorphic JavaScript
    web applications. However, with the changing web development world, we all need
    to modernize ourselves as developers to learn new frameworks and build new tools.
    It is important to analyze the code methodology of the framework and adopt the
    same, rather than getting lost in the framework market. ReactJS is an open source
    JavaScript library, similar to Bootstrap, used for building user interfaces and
    is famously known as the *V* (view) in *MVC*. When we talk about defining *M*
    and *C,* we can use other frameworks, such as Redux and Flux, to handle the remote
    data.

- en: Bootstrap is an open source frontend framework for developing responsive websites
    and web applications. It includes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code to build user
    interface components. It’s a faster and easier way to develop a powerful mobile-first
    responsive design. The Bootstrap library includes responsive 12-column grids and
    predefined classes for easy layout options (fixed width and full width). Bootstrap
    has dozens of prestyled reusable components and custom jQuery plugins, such as button,
    alerts, dropdowns, modal, tooltip tab, pagination, carousal, badges, and icons.

- en: This book starts with a detailed study of ReactJS and Bootstrap. The book further
    introduces us on how to create small components of ReactJS with Twitter Bootstrap,
    React-Bootstrap, and so on. It also gives us an understanding  on JSX, Redux,
    and Node.js integration for advanced concepts such as reducers, actions, store,
    live reload, and webpack. The goal is to help readers to build responsive and
    scalable web applications with ReactJS and Bootstrap.
