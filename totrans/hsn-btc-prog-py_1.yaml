    bitcoin ecosystem. The bitcoin ecosystem runs by its users getting, spending,
    and sending bitcoin wallets. In order to understand the concepts of this chapter,
    you should have at least a basic understanding of the command line on the computer
    you're using, and you should have Python 3.x installed on your computer.

- en: Bitcoin is a digital currency. This means that it exists only as an electronic
    record, and, unlike physical currency, you cannot hold it in your hand. You can
    send and receive money using bitcoin (just as you can with other methods), as
    well as pay for things and services with bitcoin. Bitcoin is interchangeable with
    traditional money.

- en: There are exchanges where you can buy and sell bitcoin. There are many other
    digital currencies, but bitcoin is the first and the most popular. Bitcoin uses
    peer-to-peer technology to operate, with no central authority or banks managing
    transactions, and the issuing of bitcoin is carried out collectively by the network.

    and everybody can use it. Bitcoin is digital and decentralized. For the first
    time in history, people can exchange value without intermediaries, which translates
    to greater control of funds and lower fees.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Fast and easy payments**: It''s extremely easy and fast to make payments
    with bitcoin. You do not have to worry about which software to use. The bitcoin
    network never sleeps, even on holidays. Sending payments internationally is also
    very easy; there are no banks to make anyone wait three business days, no extra
    fees for making an international transfer, and no special limitations on the minimum
    or maximum amount one can send.'

    info; one does not need to sign up or share any card information. In fact, it
    is even possible to send a payment without revealing one''s identity, almost like
    you can with physical money. However, take note that some effort may be required
    to protect privacy.'

- en: '**Negligible ****transaction f****ees**: There are very little or minimal transaction
    fees while making payments with bitcoin. There are no fees to receive bitcoins,
    and having many wallets allows you to control how large a fee to pay when spending.
    Most wallets have reasonable default fees, and higher fees can encourage faster
    confirmation of your transactions. Fees are unrelated to the amount transferred,
    so it''s possible to send 100,000 bitcoins for the same fee it costs to send one
    bitcoin.'

- en: '**Secure**: Bitcoins are created and held electronically, but there is no credit
    card number involved that someone can steal as nobody can charge you money on
    your behalf. The transactions are made using military-grade cryptography and are
    highly confidential. Bitcoin will provide full access over your money and a high
    level of protection against almost all types of fraudulent works which involves
    certain steps.'

    of a group of people authorize the transaction.'

    all payment systems. There are many third-party payment processing services that
    provide APIs. We don''t need to store bitcoins on our server. If you don''t use
    any third-party APIs, you can integrate a bitcoin node directly into your applications,
    allowing it to become your own bank and payment processor.'

- en: In simple terms, a blockchain is a digital ledger. It's a public record of bitcoin
    transactions arranged in chronological order. It is a permissionless, distributed
    database based on the bitcoin protocol that maintains a continuously growing list
    of transactional data records. It is distributed so that each participant has
    the copy of the whole blockchain. The blockchain is shared between all bitcoin
    users.

    spending. It is secure and immutable, and it's also hardened against tampering
    and revision, even by operators of the data store's nodes.

    working as data store nodes. A blockchain is made up of blocks. A block is a record

    the blockchain through mining. It is a file called the bitcoin blockchain sitting
    on thousands of computers across the world, perhaps even on your own PC at home.

    bitcoins from one account to another—that have ever happened.

    bitcoin transactions, and it keeps all records of bitcoin transactions since the
    very first transaction. The initial and most widely known application of blockchain
    technology was the public ledger of transactions for bitcoin. However, digital
    currencies are not the only use for blockchain technology.

    of transactions, such as digital contract signing. blockchain technology can be
    used to create a permanent public transparent ledger system for compiling data
    on sales, storing rights data by authenticating copyright registration, and so
    on.

    Trezor is a hardware wallet that has a lot more security, and we can even sign
    transactions, connect to an online device, and spend bitcoins from this wallet.
    It is a separate device, so it's much more secure and less prone to hacking. It
    is also recommended that you use bitcoin cold storage for a large number of bitcoins.
    Bitcoin cold storage can be held offline, like in a paper-money wallet. For this
    purpose, you can get a bitcoin address from [bitaddress.org](https://www.bitaddress.org/bitaddress.org-v3.3.0-SHA256-dec17c07685e1870960903d8f58090475b25af946fe95a734f88408cef4aa194.html),
    which can be used to send bitcoins and then store the details offline.
