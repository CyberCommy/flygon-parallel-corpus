- en: With so many amazing books out there in the cyber security and Python programming
    space, written by brilliant people, what does this book have to offer that's different?
    It's a very valid question, so now let's try to answer this.

- en: This book makes a humble attempt to capture the practical and hands-on experience
    I have acquired working with Python and the penetration testing space over the
    past few years. It is a unique amalgamation of Python, penetration testing/offensive
    security, defensive security, and machine learning use cases in the pentesting
    ecosystem. The book starts off gently, covering all the key concepts of Python,
    enabling the reader to acquire a very decent grasp of Python by the end of the
    first four chapters, before then clicking into gear and delving into the hard
    core automation of penetration testing and cyber security use cases. Readers will
    find out how to develop industry standard vulnerability scanners from scratch,
    identical to Nessus and Qualys. The book then explores concepts concerning web
    application vulnerabilities, their exploitation, and automating web exploitation
    with custom tailored exploits. It also affords very deep insights into reverse
    engineering, fuzzing, and buffer overflow vulnerabilities in both Windows and
    Linux environments, utilizing Python as a centerpiece. There is a section dedicated
    to custom exploit development, with a focus on evading anti-virus detection. The
    book also has a chapter dedicated to developing a web crawler and its utilization
    in the cyber security space. The book also gives decent insights on defensive
    security concepts, talking about cyber threat intelligence, and how a custom threat
    scoring algorithm can be developed. The book concludes with many other beneficial
    use cases of Python, such as developing a custom keylogger.

    with little or no knowledge of Python, and require in-depth insights into how
    the pentesting ecosystem and Python combine to create offensive tools, exploits,
    automate cyber security use cases, and much more besides, then this book is for
    you. *Hands-On Penetration Testing with Python* guides you through the advanced
    uses of Python for cyber security and pentesting, helping you to better understand
    security loopholes within your infrastructure.
