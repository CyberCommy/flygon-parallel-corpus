- en: Big data – that was our motivation to explore the world of machine learning
    with Spark a couple of years ago. We wanted to build machine learning applications
    that would leverag models trained on large amounts of data, but the beginning
    was not easy. Spark was still evolving, it did not contain a powerful machine
    learning library, and we were still trying to figure out what it means to build
    a machine learning application.

- en: But, step by step, we started to explore different corners of the Spark ecosystem
    and followed Spark’s evolution. For us, the crucial part was a powerful machine
    learning library, which would provide features such as R or Python libraries did.
    This was an easy task for us, since we are actively involved in the development
    of H2O’s machine learning library and its branch called Sparkling Water, which
    enables the use of the H2O library from Spark applications. However, model training
    is just the tip of the machine learning iceberg. We still had to explore how to
    connect Sparkling Water to Spark RDDs, DataFrames, and DataSets, how to connect
    Spark to different data sources and read data, or how to export models and reuse
    them in different applications.

- en: During our journey, Spark evolved as well. Originally, being a pure Scala project,
    it started to expose Python and, later, R interfaces. It also took its Spark API
    on a long journey from low-level RDDs to a high-level DataSet, exposing a SQL-like
    interface. Furthermore, Spark also introduced the concept of machine learning
    pipelines, adopted from the scikit-learn library known from Python. All these
    improvements made Spark a great tool for data transformation and data processing.

    the world via this book. Its intention is simple: to demonstrate different aspects
    of building Spark machine learning applications on examples, and show how to use
    not only the latest Spark features, but also low-level Spark interfaces. On our
    journey, we also figure out many tricks and shortcuts not only connected to Spark,
    but also to the process of developing machine learning applications or source
    code organization. And all of them are shared in this book to help keep readers
    from making the mistakes we made.'

- en: 'The book adopted the Scala language as the main implementation language for
    our examples. It was a hard decision between using Python and Scala, but at the
    end Scala won. There were two main reasons to use Scala: it provides the most
    mature Spark interface and most applications deployed in production use Scala,
    mostly because of its performance benefits due to the JVM. Moreover, all source
    code shown in this book is also available online.'
