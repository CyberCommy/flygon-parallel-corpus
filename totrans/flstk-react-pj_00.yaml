- en: This book explores the potential of developing full-stack JavaScript web applications
    by combining the power of React with industry tested server-side technologies,
    such as Node, Express, and MongoDB. The JavaScript landscape has been growing
    rapidly for some time now. With an abundance of options and resources available
    on this subject matter, it is easy to get lost when you need to choose from these
    frequently changing parts, learn about them, and make them work together to build
    your own web applications. In an attempt to address this pain point, the book
    adopts a practical approach to help you set up and build a diverse range of working
    applications using this popular JavaScript stack.

    React, but no previous experience with full-stack development involving Node,
    Express, and MongoDB, and who want practical guidelines to start building different
    types of web applications with this stack.
