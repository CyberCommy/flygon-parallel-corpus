- en: At the heart of a frontend application are *events*. JavaScript allows us to
    listen for and react to user and browser events to change content for the user
    in an intuitive fashion to create elegant user interfaces and experiences. We
    need to know how to use these packets of data that are thrown around. Browser
    events are our bread and butter—they allow us to have more than a static application
    and, instead, be dynamic! By understanding events, you'll be on your way to becoming
    a full JavaScript developer.

    This is our **capture** phase. When the button is clicked, an event is *dispatched*
    into the event flow. First, the event looks at the document object. It then travels
    through the layers of the DOM until it reaches the intended destination: the button.'

- en: There are a few interesting pieces here, such as our sticky click handler starting
    on line 29\. Most of this should look familiar, with the addition of a few new
    friends. First, the click handler is using the event's target property to set
    text in our message box with attributes of the target. We don't have to search
    through the DOM in order to find our properties. In fact, doing so would be an
    expensive and wasteful operation when we have the information passed to us already
    with the event object. Line 33 modifies the CSS of the modal window to display
    it, and on line 37, we remove the sticky when the delete button of the modal is
    clicked.

    creation logic and abstracted it to be attached to the whole container. When `container`
    is clicked, we check to see whether the target has `box` as its class. If so,
    we execute our logic! This is a more efficient use of event listeners, especially
    when used on dynamically created elements. There are cases where event delegation
    will be your best option and times when either will work.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We've learned about events, their life cycle, and how event-driven design works.
    An **event** is triggered by an action by the user (or programmatically based
    on the program logic) and enters its **life cycle**. In the event life cycle,
    our program can pick up on many pieces of information carried by the **event object**
    itself, such as the mouse position or target DOM node.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: By understanding how Ajax works with events, you're well on your way toward
    becoming a fully fledged JavaScript developer. **Ajax** is incredibly important
    as its the conduit between JavaScript and external APIs. Since JavaScript is stateless
    and client-side JavaScript has no concept of sessions, it's important for Ajax
    calls to be **asynchronous** in nature; hence the introduction of tools such as
    `fetch`.
