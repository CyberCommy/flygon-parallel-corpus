- en: Navicat is a GUI tool used for managing every aspect of a MySQL Server, such
    as managing visual tools as well as an intelligent code editor for handcoding
    SQL and stored procedures. While some of its features are fairly intuitive, some
    of them require guidance to be discovered and learned.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The book starts with creating basic server connection setups, designing databases
    from scratch, or importing existing data. Then it continues with using advanced
    features, such as designing functions and stored procedures, creating event triggers,
    and creating and scheduling batch jobs.

- en: The chapters are ordered in a logical progression, where the user starts from
    simple structures to complex design, and is gradually introduced to advanced features.
    By the end of the last chapter, the reader should be able to handle every aspect
    of database administration as well as how to master the intelligent code editor,
    in the case of a development need, such as functions and procedures.
