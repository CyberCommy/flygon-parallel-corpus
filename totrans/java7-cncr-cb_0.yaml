- en: 'When you work with a computer, you can do several things at once. You can hear
    music while you edit a document in a word processor and read your e-mail. This
    can be done because your operating system allows the concurrency of tasks. Concurrent
    programming is about the elements and mechanisms a platform offers to have multiple
    tasks or programs running at once and communicate with each other to exchange
    data or to synchronize with each other. Java is a concurrent platform and offers
    a lot of classes to execute concurrent tasks inside a Java program. With each
    version, Java increases the functionalities offered to programmers to facilitate
    the development of concurrent programs. This book covers the most important and
    useful mechanisms included in Version 7 of the Java concurrency API, so you will
    be able to use them directly in your applications, which are as follows:'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 1](ch01.html "Chapter 1. Thread Management"), *Thread Management*
    will teach the readers how to make basic operations with threads. Creation, execution,
    and status management of the threads are explained through basic examples.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 2](ch02.html "Chapter 2. Basic Thread Synchronization"), *Basic Thread
    Synchronization* will teach the readers to use the low-level Java mechanisms to
    synchronize a code. Locks and the `synchronized` keyword are explained in detail.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 3](ch03.html "Chapter 3. Thread Synchronization Utilities"), *Thread
    Synchronization Utilities* will teach the readers to use the high-level utilities
    of Java to manage the synchronization between the threads in Java. It includes
    an explanation of how to use the new Java 7 `Phaser` class to synchronize tasks
    divided into phases.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 4](ch04.html "Chapter 4. Thread Executors"), *Thread Executors* will
    teach the readers to delegate the thread management to executors. They allow running,
    managing, and getting the results of concurrent tasks.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 5](ch05.html "Chapter 5. Fork/Join Framework"), *Fork/Join Framework*
    will teach the readers to use the new Java 7 Fork/Join framework. It’s a special
    kind of executor oriented to execute tasks that will be divided into smaller ones
    using the divide and conquer technique.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 6](ch06.html "Chapter 6. Concurrent Collections"), *Concurrent Collections*
    will teach the readers to how to use some concurrent data structures provided
    by the Java language. These data structures must be used in concurrent programs
    to avoid the use of synchronized blocks of code in their implementation.'

- en: '[Chapter 7](ch07.html "Chapter 7. Customizing Concurrency Classes"), *Customizing
    Concurrency Classes* will teach the readers how to adapt some of the most useful
    classes of the Java concurrency API to their needs.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 8](ch08.html "Chapter 8. Testing Concurrent Applications"), *Testing
    Concurrent Applications* will teach the readers how to obtain information about
    the status of some of the most useful structures of the Java 7 concurrency API.
    The readers will also learn how to use some free tools to debug concurrent applications,
    such as the Eclipse, NetBeans IDE, or FindBugs applications to detect possible
    bugs on their applications.'

- en: If you are a Java developer, who wants to take his knowledge of concurrent programming
    and multithreading further, as well as discover the new concurrency features of
    Java 7, then *Java 7 Concurrency Cookbook* is for you. You should already be comfortable
    with general Java development practices and a basic grasp of threads would be
    an advantage.
