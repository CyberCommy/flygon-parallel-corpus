    the report. This is easier said than done. The report must be done in a professional
    manner and not rushed. If the report is not properly planned out, you are at risk
    of wasting valuable time and producing a report that does not meet your goal.

    You definitely do not want to leave out any of the work you did, especially for
    a business client.

    just you visiting every cubical and office to make sure someone wasn't hosting
    a honeypot. The planning process is not to be overlooked. It helps to know whether
    you missed or forgot to add something to your report. What you don't want to do
    is hand in your report uncompleted.

    that the business can be exploited? Does the company have any competitors or known
    targets that would possibly attack the network? What is the ease of access, level
    of access, the difficulty in discovering the vulnerability and exploiting it,
    and the value assets of the business? Is there customer information or data that

    information to further secure the weakness.
