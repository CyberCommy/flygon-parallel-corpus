- en: Howdy! This book intends to be a hands-on introduction to dependency injection
    with Go. It may surprise you to learn that there are many different methods for
    applying dependency injection available in the Go language and, in this book,
    we will discuss six different and occasionally complementary options.

- en: Dependency injection, like many software engineering concepts, is easily and
    often misunderstood, so this text seeks to address that. It delves into related
    concepts, such as the principles of SOLID, code smells, and test-induced damage,
    so as to offer a broader and more practical view.

- en: The aim of *Hands-On Dependency Injection in Go* is not only to teach you how
    to apply dependency injection, but also when, where, and when not to. Each of
    the methods is clearly defined; we discuss its advantages and disadvantages, and
    when the method is best applied. Also, each method is applied step by step using
    significant examples.

- en: As much as I love dependency injection, it's not always the right tool for the
    job. This book will also help you spot situations where applying dependency injection
    is perhaps not the best option.

- en: As each dependency injection method is introduced, I would ask you to pause
    for a moment, step back, and consider the following. What problem is the technique
    trying to resolve? And what would your code look like after you apply this method?
    Don't worry if the answers to these questions don't come quickly; by the end of
    the book, they will.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book is designed for developers who wish that their code was easy to read,
    test, and maintain. It is intended for developers coming from an object-oriented
    background who want to get more out of Go, as well as for developers who believe
    that quality code is about more than delivering one particular feature.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: After all, writing code is easy. Similarly, getting a single test case to pass
    is simple. Creating code whose tests continue to pass after months or years of
    adding additional features is heading toward the impossible.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For us to be able to deliver code at that level consistently, we require a lot
    of nifty tricks. This book hopes to not only equip you with those tricks, but
    also to give you the wisdom to apply them effectively.

    of building and consuming HTTP-based REST APIs. In [Chapter 4](9b5a6d56-9d43-4a12-a580-6ca8b13b9201.xhtml),
    *Introduction to the ACME Registration Service*, we will introduce an example
    REST service that will form the basis for many of the examples in the book. To
    be able to run this sample service, you will need to be able to install and configure
    a MySQL database service on your development environment and be able to customize
    the supplied configuration to match your local environment. All of the commands
    provided in this book were developed and tested under OSX and should work without
    modification on any Linux- or Unix-based system. Developers with Windows-based
    development environments will need to adjust the commands before running them.
