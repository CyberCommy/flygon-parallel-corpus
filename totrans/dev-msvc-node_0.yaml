- en: 'This book is a hands-on guide to start writing microservices using Node.js
    and the most modern frameworks, especially Seneca and PM2\. In the chapters, we
    will discuss how to design, build, test, and deploy microservices using the best
    practices. We will also discuss a valuable lesson: how to make the right level
    of compromise in order to avoid over-designing and get the business requirements
    aligned with the technical solutions.'

    and how to run it using PM2\. We will also dive into a few alternatives to Seneca
    and PM2.'

    In this chapter, we will discuss how to do it using Seneca.'

    framework) to mock services. Swagger will be our choice for documenting microservices.'

    explains how, using PM2, we are going to learn to deploy microservices in our
    different environments, managing our ecosystem of applications with a single command
    and reducing the overhead introduced by the microservices architecture. We will
    also discuss Docker, one of the most advanced systems to deploy applications not
    only in Node.js, but also in general applications.'

- en: This book is for developers that have some experience with Node.js but want
    to learn about Seneca and microservices. It is 70% practice-oriented (as we will
    be writing a lot of code), but it also is 30% theory, based on the code created
    that will help the reader to apply the exposed patterns to new software.
