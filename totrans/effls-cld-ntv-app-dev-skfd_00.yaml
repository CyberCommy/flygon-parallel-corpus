- en: 'Tooling around Kubernetes has changed drastically over the years, given the
    hype around it. More and more developers are looking for tools that can help them
    get started quickly with Kubernetes. It also causes some confusion among developers:
    which tool they should use in order to spend less time configuring their local
    setup, or writing scripts to automate their inner dev loop workflow? Moreover,
    developers require better tools while working with Kubernetes because the focus
    should be on the task at hand, that is, coding, rather than agonizing about how
    and where they will deploy an application. Ideally, you would prefer a tool that
    provides extensibility to support various use cases.'
