- en: This book is here to help you get familiar with Apache Kafka and to solve your
    challenges related to the consumption of millions of messages in publisher-subscriber
    architectures. It is aimed at getting you started programming with Kafka so that
    you will have a solid foundation to dive deep into different types of implementations
    and integrations for Kafka producers and consumers.

- en: In addition to an explanation of Apache Kafka, we also spend a chapter exploring
    Kafka integration with other technologies such as Apache Hadoop and Apache Storm.
    Our goal is to give you an understanding not just of what Apache Kafka is, but
    also how to use it as a part of your broader technical infrastructure. In the
    end, we will walk you through operationalizing Kafka where we will also talk about
    administration.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the simplest case, a single Linux-based (CentOS 6.x) machine with JDK 1.6
    installed will give a platform to explore almost all the exercises in this book.
    We assume you are familiar with command line Linux, so any modern distribution
    will suffice.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Some of the examples need multiple machines to see things working, so you will
    require access to at least three such hosts; virtual machines are fine for learning
    and exploration.

- en: As we also discuss the big data technologies such as Hadoop and Storm, you will
    generally need a place to run your Hadoop and Storm clusters.
