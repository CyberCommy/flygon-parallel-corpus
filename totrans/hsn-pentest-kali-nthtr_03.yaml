    to be concerned about any security threats or weaknesses in a system. With the
    advancement of technologies and mobile devices, a lot of persons seek to understand
    the art of exploiting computing systems and networks. The creation of the internet
    was a major milestone that improved the sharing and availability of information
    not only within an institution but globally. As information and knowledge became
    more readily available, a lot of people leveraged it for both good and bad purposes
    in the digital world.

    and techniques of taking advantage of a vulnerability/weakness on another person's
    computer or network. That's quite scary, isn't it? A simple example is a disgruntled
    employee within an organization who works as administrative staff, who isn’t knowledgeable
    about the field of cybersecurity or computing. The disgruntled employee may want
    to cause harm to the organization upon leaving the company, such as destroying
    the data stored in the company's local file server. If they decide to research
    various hacking techniques during their free time, this can eventually turn into
    an *i**nsider threat*.

    for many IT professionals. What makes this so interesting is that a penetration
    tester has to discover many methods to successfully exploit a system. At times,
    an exploit may work on one a system of a client or target but not on another.
    This is where the creativity mindset of a penetration tester is most needed. Personally,
    I like the challenge of trying to gain access (as a penetration tester) into a
    system that seems to be a bit challenging; what’s the fun if everything is easy
    to hack?

    breach on their network and the time of detection is usually months after the

    of the target’s systems and network is known prior to the simulated attack. This
    can be beneficial to the penetration tester as they would have ample information
    about the target network and can better utilize tools and resources in creating,
    delivering, and executing payloads that would most likely be successful on the
    first attempt. However, there is a disadvantage to this type of penetration test.
    The ethical hacker or penetration tester most likely won’t be looking for any
    hidden vulnerabilities and systems outside the knowledge that was provided prior
    to the testing,or for the complete knowledge of the infrastructure of the system.

    a penetration methodology prior to the actual penetration test is quite important,
    it will create a systematic approach in achieving each objective of the pen test.

    and understanding on the type of tests that will be conducted, the duration of
    the testing, the target systems and networks, if remote testing is done-the source
    IP address if possible, intrusive or non-intrusive testing, and so on.

    testers, to check the security controls and discover any hidden vulnerabilities
    within their systems or network. At times, an organization may contract a penetration
    tester to simulate real-world attacks on their web applications, while another
    company may want security auditing on their Windows servers. Having a single methodology
    does not always apply to each target from a penetration tester's perspective.
    This is where the penetration tester can create their own methodology to fit the
    type of testing required for the target.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    phase is very helpful. Let’s think of this as a military operation; before launching
    an attack, the General or someone of high authority would send a unit of soldiers
    to conduct reconnaissance and gather as much information as possible about the
    target while being undetected (stealthy). This concept also applies in penetration
    testing; the more information that is known about a target will assist the penetration
    tester in discovering flaws and weaknesses. Once a vulnerability (weakness) is
    found on a target, the next step is to use a working exploit to take advantage
    of the flaw/weakness. This is done during the attack phase.

    phase, exploiting a vulnerability is done to gain access to the target system
    and/or network. Sometimes, an exploit may not work and this can be a bit frustrating.
    Having an exploit-development environment is useful for a situation where a particular
    payload does not compromise a target. However, a penetration tester should not
    only rely on a single point of entry into a target but rather have multiple methods
    of gaining access. This concept not only demonstrates the technical skillset of
    the penetration tester but the many flaws within the target itself.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The information gathered about the target during the pre-attack phase will be
    utilized to determine the type of exploit to use on the target. Acquiring the
    target can be done using existing exploits found from reputable online repositories
    such as **Exploit Database by Offensive Security** ([www.exploit-db.com](http://www.exploit-db.com))
    or using an exploitation development framework such as **Metasploit** ([https://www.rapid7.com/products/metasploit/](https://www.rapid7.com/products/metasploit/)).

    minimize detection, then they will attempt to escalate privileges to either a
    system/administration or root privileges. During this phase, the penetration tester
    implants malicious code within the compromised systems to create backdoors for
    remote access and begins lateral movement on the network to compromise other potential
    targets.

    and you were probably very eager to hack something. Imagine you’re on the client’s
    network, and you begin to stimulate your attacks all at once, focusing on a particular
    set of vulnerabilities or systems. A lot of misfires can occur – exploits can
    hit targets that are not specified within the scope of the penetration test agreements –
    and this can be bad for business and create a bad reputation. Secondly, without
    using a systematic approach, the desired result probably won’t be attained at
    the end of your testing.

    choose a methodology or framework best suited for the potential target’s infrastructure.

    things you learn during a penetration-testing training course is the five phases
    of hacking. In each phase, there are objectives to complete as a penetration tester/ethical
    hacker; one phase leads to the next until the final stage is completed:'

    phase helps the penetration tester identify open and closed ports, active hosts
    on a network, services running on a system and network, operating system types,
    and vulnerabilities on systems. During the scanning phase, the information gathered
    will provide the penetration tester with a topological view of the target's environment.

    to create multiple instances of backdoor access in the event that they are no
    longer able to access the system via the exploit. Some penetration testers use
    this opportunity to implant **Remote Access Trojans** (**RATs**) or create a botnet
    to control the compromised systems.

    all the vulnerabilities found with full details. The penetration test report also
    contains evidence of the vulnerabilities compromised per system to indicate the
    proof of concept. This can be helpful for the client’s security team to implement
    mitigation techniques and prevention controls on their infrastructure. Some penetration-testing
    reports contain mitigation techniques while others don’t. This is determined by
    the mutual agreement between the client and the penetration tester of the services
    to be rendered.

    tests conducted and the outcome of each. As penetration testers, our write-ups
    tend to be a bit too technical at times, however our final report should be written
    at an executive level where non-technical people can read and understand them.

    world and for the future. As new threats emerge, the security of our assets and
    data is more at risk than ever. We did a brief comparison and contrasted between
    different types of hackers and their possible motives for hacking. Furthermore,
    we discussed the need for various security teams within an organization to help
    improve the security posture of the ever-growing threat landscape, and finally,
    we discussed hacking methodologies and concepts.
