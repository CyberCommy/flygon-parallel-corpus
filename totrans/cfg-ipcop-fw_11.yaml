- en: We have now covered the topic of IPCop and are aware of its uses within our
    network and whether IPCop is useful for our particular network and organization.
    The driving force behind IPCop is its open-source nature and the community behind
    it, which we have tried to emphasize throughout this book.

- en: We have seen how collections of quite simple tools can create very complex and
    powerful systems. We also know how to configure these tools using the IPCop interface
    and how to manage and enhance IPCop itself. This is all possible because of the
    strong open-source community behind IPCop. Including all user and developers,
    who constantly further the development of IPCop to create a system that can truly
    be an effective SOHO router, firewall, and powerful network appliance. As we have
    shown throughout, the tools involved are numerous and there are many developers
    and users involved. Combining all the developers of all the tools involved in
    IPCop easily runs into multiple thousands of highly skilled personnel creating
    the product we use.

    These same developers who wrote the system, compiled, tested, debugged, and shipped
    it also offer their time to help support users using it.

- en: There are a number of support mechanisms for IPCop as with most open-source
    software. The most accessible of these is the IPCop website itself [http://www.ipcop.org](http://www.ipcop.org),
    which has documentation, tutorials, and FAQs. It helps any open-source project
    immensely, if users check the IPCop website for any questions that they need answers
    for, before using the other support mechanisms that might distract another user
    or developer from their own tasks. If we have problems that this book doesn't
    address and we can't find the solutions by searching the Web with our favorite
    search engine or by searching the IPCop website, then we can consider alternative
    support mechanisms.

    from each other and often from the IPCop developers themselves. You should go
    here with ideas for new features, help with current features, or as a preliminary
    check when you believe you have found a bug in the IPCop software. This list can
    be found at [http://lists.sourceforge.net/mailman/listinfo/ipcop-users](http://lists.sourceforge.net/mailman/listinfo/ipcop-users).'

    software and Freenode, the network that hosts the #ipcop channel, has a variety
    of official support channels for open-source software. You will often find around
    50 users online at any point in time—the authors being among the regular visitors.
    Most users in this channel help each other out and hang around discussing the
    product, comparing it to other products, and very often discussing feature requests
    or "wish lists".'

    is often better to go directly to the source, in this case the addon developers,
    to get comprehensive support on their product.

    they have found useful and IPCop offers such avenues.
  prefs: []

- en: The most obvious way to support open-source software is by furthering the software
    development. Users are welcome to develop for IPCop and can do so by creating
    addons as many users have done, or by writing code for the core of IPCop itself,
    which is often welcomed by the current developers as it eases the load and ensures
    that IPCop can be developed in all areas that require attention.

    charitable donations as a duty for the IPCop developers and requires added, unnecessary,
    administration. You can, however, elect to pay the developers themselves in order
    to work on IPCop. This is the simplest way to give money in support of their efforts.

    that if we like a project and support it, we can generally help it get better
    or help maintain it. Another example of support is writing books and other documentation,
    such as this one that brings more users to the project by lowering the skills
    barrier required and ensuring everything is adequately explained.

    and can even redistribute it, even modified, if needed. The software can be taken
    in another direction much like IPCop's own creation where it was forked from Smoothwall.
    This ensures that the software stays around and is useful for years to come, as
    you can be confident that there will be enough users turned into developers to
    keep the project going.

    device that fits your specifications and modify and tune it as necessary. There
    are options and choices and the software has the protection of the GPL to allow
    it to survive any issues it has. This means that you can be quite confident in
    the choice of software as your network doesn't rely on a corporation staying afloat
    but rather on thousands of users and developers around the world, showing that
    they can and will work together in order to create truly remarkable software.
