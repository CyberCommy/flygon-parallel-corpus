- en: With recent advancements in the Python ecosystem and the availability of a huge
    number of libraries that support high re-usability and enable the compilation
    of modular code, Python can be used to build applications that can solve an organization's
    problems. These applications can be developed in short timeframes and, if developed
    carefully, can allow them to be scaled in a manner that solves the needs of an
    organization.

- en: An enterprise application is a critical application that aims to solve the specific
    business needs of an organization. The requirements of an enterprise application
    differ greatly from those that are usually needed by an individual. These applications
    are supposed to provide high performance and scalability to enable the increasing
    everyday needs of an organization.

- en: Keeping this in mind, this book is intended for developers who have an intermediate
    knowledge of coding in Python and are willing to dive deeper into building applications
    that can be scaled up, based on the needs of the organization. The book provides
    several examples that can be executed on Python 3.7 running on Linux-based distributions,
    but which also work on other operating systems.

    the language. We also choose to run Odoo in an Ubuntu host (a popular cloud hosting
    option) and will do some work on the command line, so some familiarity will be
    beneficial.
