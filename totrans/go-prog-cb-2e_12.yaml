- en: In this chapter, we will discuss reactive programming design patterns in Go.
    Reactive programming is a programming concept that focuses on data streams and
    the propagation of change. Technologies such as Kafka allow you to quickly produce
    or consume a stream of data. As a result, these technologies are a natural fit
    for one another. In the *Connecting Kafka to Goflow* recipe, we'll explore combining
    a `kafka` message queue with `goflow` to show a practical example of using these
    technologies. This chapter will also explore various ways to connect with Kafka
    and use it to process messages. Lastly, this chapter will demonstrate how to create
    a basic `graphql` server in Go.

- en: The `github.com/trustmaster/goflow` package works by defining a network/graph,
    registering some components, and then wiring them together. This can feel a bit
    error-prone since components are described using strings, but usually this will
    fail early in runtime until the application is set up and functioning correctly.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this recipe, we set up two components, one that Base64-encodes an incoming
    string, and one that prints anything passed to it. We connect it to an in channel
    that is initialized in `main.go`, and anything passed onto that channel will flow
    through our pipeline.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A lot of the emphasis of this approach is on ignoring the internals of what's
    going on. We treat everything like a connected black box and let `goflow` do the
    rest. You can see, in this recipe, how small the code is to accomplish this pipeline
    of tasks and that we have fewer knobs to control the number of workers, among
    other things.

    should use a serialization format such as `json`, `gob`, `protobuf`, or others.
    The producer can send a message to Kafka synchronously through `sendMessage`.
    This does not handle cases well where the Kafka cluster is down, and may result
    in a hung process for these cases. This is important to consider for applications
    such as web handlers, as it may result in timeouts and hard dependencies on the
    Kafka cluster.

- en: This recipe combines ideas from previous recipes in this chapter. As in previous
    recipes, we set up a Kafka consumer and producer. This recipe uses the synchronous
    producer from the *Using Kafka with Sarama* recipe, but could have also used an
    asynchronous producer instead. Once a message is received, we enqueue it on an
    in channel just as we did in the *Goflow for dataflow programming* recipe*.* We
    modify the components from this recipe to convert our incoming string to uppercase,
    rather than Base64-encoding it. We reuse the print components and the resultant
    network configuration is similar.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The end result is that all messages received through the Kafka consumer are
    transported into our flow-based work pipeline to be operated on. This allows us
    to instrument our pipeline components to be modular and reusable, and we can use
    the same component multiple times in different configurations. Similarly, we'll
    receive traffic from any producer that writes to Kafka, so we can multiplex producers
    into a single data stream.

    to resolve card objects to responses. Next, we jump into `resolve.go`, where we
    define how to filter cards by value and type. This `Resolve` function will be
