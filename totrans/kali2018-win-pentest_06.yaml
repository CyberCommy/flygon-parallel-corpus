- en: Back in the early days of networking, just after the birth of the PC, people
    wanted the ability to share files from one system to another. In business applications,
    systems already had the ability to network themselves using proprietary networking
    protocols such as IPX (Internetwork Packet Exchange), Tolkien Ring, and coaxial
    bus networks. One big problem with all these proprietary protocols is that none
    of them could cross-communicate between themselves. This became known as vendor
    lock-in, and we still have some of this even today with proprietary systems and
    protocols. (Yes, I am pointing the finger at you, Microsoft.) Using these protocols
    meant paying a license fee for each system on the network-not just a cost for
    the OS, but an extra cost to network each system, then an extra fee on top of
    that for each workstation connecting to a server across that network. Then, yes,
    you could have two networks remote from each other and connect them using the
    existing phone lines of the day, but the system had to be running the same OS
    and networking protocols in order to communicate. A DEC network could not talk
    to a Netware network even in the same building, much less over the phone lines.
    This was also the problem faced by the government and military, with communications
    across the country and the coming age of data transmission and phone calls routed
    through many single points of failure, with no means to make this traffic self-route.
    Communication networks could be shut down by hitting a few strategic points. A
    self-routing network with a common communication language was needed, and so along
    came ARPANET and the TCP/IP protocol suite. I was lucky enough to work on this
    in the beginning, and I never thought it would grow to what we have today.

  zh: 在网络的早期，就在个人电脑诞生之后，人们希望能够从一个系统共享文件到另一个系统。在商业应用中，系统已经可以使用专有的网络协议进行网络化，比如IPX（Internetwork
    Packet Exchange），托尔金环和同轴总线网络。所有这些专有协议的一个大问题是，它们都不能在它们之间进行交叉通信。这被称为供应商锁定，即使在今天，我们仍然有一些专有系统和协议。（是的，我在指责你，微软。）使用这些协议意味着为网络上的每个系统支付许可费-不仅是操作系统的成本，而且还需要额外的费用来网络化每个系统，然后在连接到网络的每个工作站上再额外收费。然后，是的，你可以让两个远离彼此的网络使用当时的电话线连接起来，但是系统必须运行相同的操作系统和网络协议才能进行通信。DEC网络甚至不能在同一建筑物内与Netware网络进行通信，更不用说通过电话线进行通信了。这也是政府和军方所面临的问题，跨国通信和数据传输时代的到来，电话呼叫通过许多单点故障路由，没有办法使这些流量自行路由。通信网络可以通过打击一些战略要点而被关闭。需要一个自路由网络和一个共同的通信语言，于是ARPANET和TCP/IP协议套件出现了。我很幸运能在开始时参与其中，我从来没有想过它会发展成今天的样子。
- en: During this time, Microsoft came up with their own protocols to network Windows
    systems, but again, these protocols are proprietary and could only run on Windows
    systems. The first of these was NetBUI. NetBUI was a non-routable protocol that
    needed very little configuration, and systems connected to the same local switch
    or hub could communicate and happily share files and data; however, if you wished
    to send a file across town, well, better get yourself a floppy. If you had a UNIX
    box on your local network, you would again need your floppy to transfer data from
    your Windows PC to the UNIX server. NetBUI was Windows-only! Sure, it was easy
    to use-you didn't need to be a network engineer to connect to the network, you
    just plugged in your cable and magically, by knowing the names of the other computers,
    you could connect to them share files, delete files, and even remotely control
    the system. Wow, that's cool! Except, in these days, Windows had no security-none.

  zh: 在这段时间里，微软推出了他们自己的协议来网络Windows系统，但是，这些协议是专有的，只能在Windows系统上运行。其中第一个是NetBUI。NetBUI是一种不可路由的协议，几乎不需要配置，连接到同一个本地交换机或集线器的系统可以进行通信并愉快地共享文件和数据；然而，如果你想要在城镇之间发送文件，那么最好准备一个软盘。如果你在本地网络上有一个UNIX系统，你还需要软盘来将数据从你的Windows
    PC传输到UNIX服务器。NetBUI只能在Windows上运行！当然，它很容易使用-你不需要成为网络工程师来连接到网络，你只需要插上你的电缆，通过知道其他计算机的名称，你就可以连接到它们共享文件，删除文件，甚至远程控制系统。哇，太酷了！除了，在那些日子里，Windows没有安全性-没有。

    see a problem with this network model?* If not, please get a refund on this book

- en: So how does this magic work? When you connected a system to the network, the
    system would send out ARP broadcasts saying, *Hey, my computer name is WS3 and
    I have these goodies stored here*. One system, normally the first one on the network,
    would be the Master Browser, which kept track of the machine names and the network
    resources. If this system went down, then all the systems on the network would
    have an election over ARP and decide who would be the next Master Browser. Now,
    this is all well and good if you have fewer than 20 machines on a network, but
    have more than 20 machines on the same network and you now have a communication
    problem which only grows with each extra machine added to the network.

    Microsoft stole David Cutler from IBM, who took his designs from IBM''s OS2 with

    login from the `\\WIN10-01` workstation. This was captured when the user logged
    on to the domain from the workstation. Notice this is a NTLMv2 hash, which is
    a salted NTLMv1 hash. A salted hash is basically a re-hashed hash. During the
    challenge and response part of the SMB login, a 16-bit random hash value is exchanged.
    The NTLMv1 56-bit hash is then hashed with this random value. This new hash, which
    is then transmitted to the server, is the NTLMv2 hash value. Since the salt is
    a random value, the captured v2 hash is non-replayable, but the good news is that
    programs, such as good old John the Ripper or Hashcat, can crack these hashes
    offline. They just can't be used in a *Pass the Hash* style attack.

- en: This module listens for a NetBIOS name request and then continuously spams NetBIOS
    responses to a target for the given hostname, causing the target to cache a malicious
    address for this name. On high-speed networks, the PPSRATE value should be increased
    to speed up this attack. As an example, a value of around 30,000 is almost 100%
    successful when spoofing a response for a WPAD lookup. Distant targets may require
    more time and lower rates for a successful attack. This module works when the
    target is behind a NAT gateway, since the stream of NetBIOS responses will keep
    the NAT mapping alive after the initial setup. To trigger the initial NetBIOS
    request to the Metasploit system, force the target to access a UNC link pointing
    to the same address (HTML, Office attachment, and so on). This NAT-piercing issue
    was named the BadTunnel vulnerability by the discoverer, Yu Yang (`@tombkeeper`).
    Microsoft patches (MS16-063/MS16-077) impact the way that the proxy host (WPAD)
    host is identified, but do not change the predictability of NetBIOS requests.

    by injecting fake updates, not only for Windows OSes but also for other popular
    Windows applications. The list is long. The framework comes with pre-made binaries
    (agents), but custom binaries can also be pushed to the victim machine. The framework
    comes with its own web server and DNS server modules.

    can be downloaded from a central repository and verified by GPG keys, with Window
    applications each application depends on its own individual updater. This allows
    this style of attack to be used on many common applications which you would never
    normally consider as an attack vector. This is also the reason why, when working
    with Kali as shown in this book, you should download your applications from the
