- en: You should find this book useful whether you are pursuing Java certification
    or want to round out your knowledge and gain further confidence in using Java.
    This book takes a different approach to prepare you for certification. It is designed
    to provide you with coverage of the topics found in the exam and to provide additional
    insights in to the use of Java and the development of Java applications. By providing
    a broader coverage, it goes beyond the immediate certification focus and provides
    a more comprehensive coverage of the language.

- en: For those pursuing Java certification, the book is organized around the major
    aspects of Java and addresses the certification topics covered by the Java SE
    7 Programmer I (1Z0-803) exam. Each chapter addresses specific certification topics,
    though some topics are covered in more than one chapter. At the end of each chapter
    are certification questions that will give you an idea of the nature of the questions
    you may encounter on the exam. The intent of the book is not to provide an exhaustive
    set of questions, but rather address those important Java concepts that will prepare
    you to answer certification questions.

    insight into Java that you may not have seen before. In particular, the diagrams
    will hopefully enhance and solidify your understanding of how Java works, especially
    those figures that describe the use of the program stack and heap. Examples are
    provided throughout the book that addresses many of the common pitfalls found
    in developing Java applications.

- en: '[Chapter 1](ch01.html "Chapter 1. Getting Started with Java"), *Getting Started
    with Java*, uses an overview of a simple Java application to present the major
    aspects of Java. The creation of a `customer` class is illustrated, along with
    the use of getter and setter methods. Also discussed is the development process,
    the types of Java applications supported, the documentation process in Java, and
    the use of annotations which have added much to the expressive power of Java.'

- en: '[Chapter 2](ch02.html "Chapter 2. Java Data Types and Their Usage"), *Java
    Data Types and Their Usage*, presents the primitive data types available in Java
    and their corresponding operators. Diagrams are used to explain how the program
    stack and heap relate to each other and how they affect the scope and lifetime
    of a variable. In addition, the use of the `String` and `StringBuilder` classes
    is illustrated and the difference between a class and an object is explained.'

- en: '[Chapter 3](ch03.html "Chapter 3. Decision Constructs"), *Decision Constructs*,
    focuses on the constructs used to make decisions in Java including the if and
    switch statements. As these constructs are dependent on logical expression, these
    types of expressions are covered. The use of the string based switch statement
    available with Java 7 is illustrated. The correct use of decision constructs is
    achieved by understanding and avoiding various pitfalls, such as the failure to
    use block statements and the multitude of problems that can occur when using floating
    point numbers in comparisons.'

- en: '[Chapter 4](ch04.html "Chapter 4. Using Arrays and Collections"), *Using Arrays
    and Collections*, focuses on the use of arrays, along with the `Arrays` and `ArrayList`
    classes. Both single and multidimensional arrays are illustrated. The `Arrays`
    class is introduced, as it possesses many important methods for manipulating arrays
    such as filling and sorting arrays. The `ArrayList` class is important as it provides
    a more flexible container than an array for many problems.'

- en: '[Chapter 5](ch05.html "Chapter 5. Looping Constructs"), *Looping Constructs*,
    demonstrates the concept of iteration in Java, via constructs such as the while
    and for loops. These are covered along with common mistakes that can be made when
    using them. The use of the for-each statement and the iterator is presented, along
    with coverage of the infinite loop and the break and continue statements.'

- en: '[Chapter 6](ch06.html "Chapter 6. Classes, Constructors, and Methods"), *Classes,
    Constructors, and Methods*, deals with the creation and use of objects and uses
    the stack/heap to explain the process. The important Java initialization sequence
    is discussed. Overloading of constructors and methods are detailed, along with
    the concepts of signatures, instance/static class members, and immutable objects.
    Data encapsulation is illustrated throughout the chapter.'

- en: '[Chapter 7](ch07.html "Chapter 7. Inheritance and Polymorphism"), *Inheritance
    and Polymorphism*, covers the critical topics of inheritance and polymorphism,
    with an enhanced discussion of constructors and methods. The use of a signature
    becomes important again when overriding is used. The power of the `super` keyword
    is explained in relation to constructors and methods. Scope is re-examined and
    the concepts of final and abstract classes are explored. The ever present `Object`
    class is also introduced.'

    *Handling Exceptions in an Application*, covers exception handling including the
    use of the new try-with-resource block and the `|` operator in a catch block.
    Several guidelines and examples dealing with exception handling are provided to
    help the reader avoid common mistakes in their use.'

    examines the use of packages in a Java application. This includes a discussion
    on the use of the package and import statements including the static import statement.
    Also discussed is the use of resource bundles to support an application that needs
    to address the international community and how to connect and use a database using
    JDBC.'
