    Most of the work boils down to knowing exactly what and how you will design and
    develop your website; planning is where all these decisions will be made.

- en: You need to first define your target and your website objective, what you want
    to achieve, and for whom. Imagine that you're creating an online e-commerce website
    for a gadget company. The objective will be to sell those gadgets online (the
    "what"), and the target would be men of the age group of 25 to 50 (the "who").
    These are usually pretty simple to understand. However, in case you ever find
    yourself with an unclear briefing from a client, make sure that you understand
    their objectives and targets beforehand, because there's nothing worse than an
    uninformed designer working on a project.

- en: However, in this case, we're creating our own portfolio page. So, essentially,
    we're creating a page intended to showcase our work (the "what") to designers
    and possible future clients (the "who"). Of course, the target in this case is
    not as easily defined as a toy company or a women's clothing store, but the target
    always exists. You can be a designer who is more interested in mobiles or fashion,
    so try to have this in mind when designing your website. Your online and offline
    images should make the viewer associate you to a certain market, and this is done
    by creating and implementing a specific approach and style to your home page design.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Unfortunately, I won't get to know you personally, so we'll have to create a
    simple and flexible designer portfolio. This should be something that can be used
    for a general portfolio, regardless of your work specialty. So, let's get down
    to planning!

    designer. We will have just a couple of sections here; they are as follows:'

    contact you, and your location'

- en: These are the essential sections we will have to design for your portfolio.
    Since this is such a small and simple site, we'll create a one-page website. This
    kind of page is being used more and more lately. This is mainly because it presents
    the user with all the information really quickly and in a very simple way. Also,
    it provides a more dynamic experience by presenting different content on just
    a single page.

    and designing your website. I usually start by creating a really simple sketch
    on paper just to mock really quickly what we're going to design. You can also
    use software such as Balsamiq to create your wireframes, but I prefer to start
    sketching on paper. So, grab a piece of paper and start sketching.

    in your projects, with some of the essential elements already designed, so we''ll
    use it to design our page. You can get the free pack, which includes a layered
    PSD, icons, Lato font, and files for our development with Twitter Bootstrap 3-based
    framework ready to use at [http://designmodo.com/flat-free/](http://designmodo.com/flat-free/).

    get down to business and execute the following steps:'

    background. This will be the canvas with our full-length website design.
  prefs:
  - PREF_OL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Let's start by creating our header. We'll need to use an avatar for our face,
    so while you can use your own avatar, I'll grab one from [http://uifaces.com/](http://uifaces.com/),
    where you can find several avatars of real users to use in your design mockups.
  prefs:
  - PREF_OL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Let's create a shape that will serve as our header background with the rectangle
    tool. You can set the color of the shape to gray, as we will decide on the colors
    later on.
  prefs:
  - PREF_OL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now that we have the foundation for our header, let's put or avatar/logo in
    it. This will be our branding area of the website. It shows what the website is
    about and who it belongs to.
  prefs:
  - PREF_OL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Create a 125 x 125 px circle and use it as a mask for your avatar. Give the
    mask a white stroke blending option with 5 px. This will create a border around
    our circle to make the avatar pop a bit more.
  prefs:
  - PREF_OL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To create our menu, we'll use text fields. Create three different text fields
    and write `ABOUT`, `WORK`, and `CONTACTS` in them. These will be our menu links.
    Set the text with the font type as Lato, font style as Bold, and text size as
    20 px. This is where you can experiment with the text style; try using lowercase
    text instead of uppercase and try a lighter weight and underline for these. You
    can adapt the links to the style of your choice, but I'll stick to the ones indicated,
    as I believe it works and looks good.
  prefs:
  - PREF_OL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So, our header is created. We're only missing the color. Let's go to [http://flatuicolors.com/](http://flatuicolors.com/)
    and get one of the colors suggested there. As I mentioned earlier in [Chapter
    3](ch03.html "Chapter 3. Creating a Flat and Usable Interface"), *Creating a Flat
    and Usable Interface*, we're setting the main color of our color scheme for the
    whole website by choosing this color. So, keep this in mind when choosing a color.
    Usually, I prefer building my color palette throughout the design of the site,
    as I'm able to try them out instantly. Choose the one of your liking; I'll use
    Peter River, `#3498db`.

- en: If you want to create an even more interesting and impactful header, you can
    also use a background image for the header. If you have an image of your work
    desk or your computer with the working files visible on your screen, these are
    great to represent your work. Put it below the colored background layer and change
    the color layer opacity to around 85 percent. This will create a blue tint effect
    on the image. The following screenshot shows a blue tint background found at [http://sendtoinc.com/](http://sendtoinc.com/):![Designing

- en: Since this is a one-page website, you might be wondering why we're using a menu
    at all. However, a menu is essential for a website, as it serves as the main navigation
    tool, and it also tells the viewer which content he or she will be able to find
    on the website. Since we're creating all our sections on just one page, this menu
    won't link to different pages, but we are able to scroll down to a specific section
    using JavaScript. This is how we will lead the viewers to the section that they
    are looking for. We'll talk more about this, the development of the code, and
    the technical side of it in [Chapter 5](ch05.html "Chapter 5. Developing Your
    Site"), *Developing Your Site*.
  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now we're going to create our `About` section. Start by creating the title with
    the font type Lato, font style Bold, and a text size of 40 px. All the words should
    be in uppercase to maintain consistency. Let's use `About Me` to make the tone
    a bit more personal. Change the color of the text to `#222222`, to avoid using
    pure black. This will make it easier on the eyes.
  prefs:
  - PREF_OL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Next, create our content. We'll create two text areas and populate them with
    our text. If you don't have text, you can generate and grab a couple of "lorem
    ipsum" paragraphs from [http://lipsum.com](http://lipsum.com) to populate the
    text areas. These two blocks will be 500 px wide each and have a spacing of 35
    px between them. Set the text type to Lato, font style to Regular, and text size
    to 14 px. Also, to make the text more readable and make the columns more visually
    geometrical, let's select the **Justify last left** option in paragraph options.
    We'll also set the leading to 20 px.
  prefs:
  - PREF_OL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To finish off our `About` section, let's open the `Designmodo flat-ui-free.psd`
    file. There you will find premade buttons that we can use, so duplicate the `Button`
    (static) folder to our document and position it below the text areas, centered
    with the page. Make sure you change the background color of the button to match
    the color that we selected earlier. Change the copy to `Download Resume`, and
    this section is completed. The following screenshot is a great example of how
    you can create visual blocks by just using content:![Designing in Photoshop](img/0048OS_04_05.jpg)
  prefs:
  - PREF_OL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Next is the work section. For this one, let's start by creating eight 225 x
    140 px rectangles and align them with 47 px of spacing between them. Create a
    2 x 4 grid with these, which will serve as containers for our project's thumbnails.
    Using thumbnails is an easy and quick way to show your projects. You can opt to
    use a lightbox plugin such as lightbox 2, which is available at [http://lokeshdhakar.com/projects/lightbox2/](http://lokeshdhakar.com/projects/lightbox2/),
    to show a larger image, or just link it directly to the entry in dribble.
  prefs:
  - PREF_OL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To create a visual separation of this block and to contrast with the other sections,
    let's set a background color for this block. However, instead of using the header
    color, which is too vivid and bright, let's use a lighter shade of the main color
    (`#99cbed`). This will create a smoother background that will allow the thumbnails
    to contrast more with the background. The following screenshot shows the final
    result:![Designing in Photoshop](img/0048OS_04_06.jpg)
  prefs:
  - PREF_OL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now, use these rectangles as clipping masks and populate the thumbnails with
    your work projects. I grabbed a couple of entries from [http://dribbble.com](http://dribbble.com)
    to populate this example. Again, we want the content to create the visual blocks,
    so we won't create any kind of borders, lines, or divisions. The way in which
    we organize content in the grid will be enough to set the visual blocks and define
    this section's layout.
  prefs:
  - PREF_OL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Our work section is now done. You can use titles above or below the thumbnails,
    but this is a simpler way of doing a work section, and it also shows that your
    work speaks for itself. By reducing the amount of elements on the page, we're
    also focusing on creating a minimalistic page, and it's impressive how simple
    a website can become while reducing the amount of superfluous elements in it.
    The following screenshot is a good example of a minimalistic page:![Designing
    in Photoshop](img/0048OS_04_07.jpg)
  prefs:
  - PREF_OL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Our `Contacts` section is also going to be really simple and minimal. There
    are several ways of creating `Contact` sections. Usually, you can build a contact
    form and show a map of of your location and use icons to represent different types
    of contacts. However, we will go down to the bare basics: a call to action the
    title, an e-mail address, and a phone number. So, let''s duplicate the `About`
    section''s title and change it to `Let''s Chat`. Using this kind of text creates
    a more personal approach to your viewers, as well as represents you as being more
    approachable, reminding the viewer that this is, in fact, a person who can be
    easily contacted.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_OL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: After the title, create two text fields in two different lines to add your e-mail
    address and your phone number. The content of this section will be simple contact
    information. For these fields, use lowercase text and set the font type to Lato,
    font style to regular, and font size to 23 px. Using a simple type like this on
    top of a flat color, we're focusing on the content and impact of the content in
    itself, as there's nothing else, such as boxes, lines, icons, or maps, to detract
    it. Flat design is very much composed by this simplicity, focusing on what's essential
    and the bare minimum. You should be able to see the result, which is similar to
    the following screenshot:![Designing in Photoshop](img/0048OS_04_08.jpg)
  prefs:
  - PREF_OL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With our `Contact` section done, we're only missing our footer to finish up
    the website. We'll create a small rectangle (50 px high) for the background and
    make it the same blue (our main color, `#3498db`) as the header. In here, we will
    simply ADD our copyright text and the social network icons linked to your accounts.
    So, create a text field and set the font type to Lato, font style to Bold, and
    font size to 12 px, with the `© 2014 Designer Name` text. Align this to the left.
  prefs:
  - PREF_OL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: On the right-hand side of the footer, let's add links to your Twitter and Facebook
    accounts so that people can connect with you. You can find social logo packs with
    these links, or you can get the official logos from the brand assets section at
    [https://www.facebookbrand.com/](https://www.facebookbrand.com/) for Facebook
    and [https://about.twitter.com/press/brand-assets](https://about.twitter.com/press/brand-assets)
    for Twitter. Since we're using our main color as the footer background, let's
    use the white versions of these logos to make them visible on top of the blue
    background. Align both of them to the right of the page. It should look like the
    following screenshot:![Designing in Photoshop](img/0048OS_04_09.jpg)
  prefs:
  - PREF_OL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The footer is the last element of the website. It serves as a place to add relevant
    links such as social network links and copyright messaging that are general to
    the page. It also serves as a visual closure of the site, and it creates the contact
    section block by visually contrasting between blue and white.

- en: Now that our website is completed, we can review the colors and element's position.
    It's always easier to make these kind of adjustments and decisions after the layout
    is constructed, as you're able to visualize all the elements joined together and
    how they look. In the end, the final choices and touches are mainly to enhance
    the website's look and feel. Spacing, color, and text make sure that by looking
    at a website as a whole, you'll feel that it works well, instead of focusing on
    individual sections.
