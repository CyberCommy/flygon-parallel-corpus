    This was the first project where we built from scratch our own backend that is
    used by the frontend. Having our own backend lets us do a lot more stuff that
    we can't do otherwiseâ€”for example, we can save the data that we like in the database
    that we created ourselves. Also, we added our own authentication system to authenticate
    the admin user. On the admin frontend, we protect our routes with the `beforeEnter`
    route guard, which checks for the authentication token before the admin user can
    log in.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the last chapter, we created a backend with Express. The endpoint accepts
    JSON data as input and returns JSON data as a response. However, it can take any
    JSON data, which the backend may not expect. Also, there is no easy way to test
    our API endpoints without the frontend. This is something that we can solve with
    GraphQL APIs. **GraphQL** is a special query language that makes communication
    easier between the client and server. GraphQL APIs have a built-in data structure
    validation. Each property has a data type, which can be a simple or complex type,
    consisting of many properties with simple data types.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We can also test GraphQL APIs with GraphiQL, which is a web page that lets us
    make our own GraphQL API requests easily. Since there is a data type validation
    for each request, it can provide an autocomplete feature, according to the definition
    of the GraphQL API schema. The schema provides us with all the data type definitions
    that are used with queries and mutations. Queries are requests that let us query
    for data with our GraphQL API, while mutations are GraphQL requests that let us
    change data in some way.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We define queries and mutations explicitly with a schema string. The queries
    and mutations take input types as data types for the input data, and return data
    with the specified output data types. Therefore, we will never be in any doubt
    about the structure of the data that we have to send to make a GraphQL request
    and will never have to guess as to what kind of data a request will return.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: GraphQL API requests are mostly just regular **HyperText Transfer Protocol**
    (**HTTP**) requests, except that they have a special structure. All requests go
    to the `/graphql` endpoint by default, and we send queries or mutations as a string
    value of the `query` property in the JSON requests. The variable values are sent
    with the `variable` parameter.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The queries and mutations are named, and all the queries and mutations are sent
    to the resolver functions with the same names in the code, instead of to route
    handlers. The functions then take the arguments specified by the schema, after
    which we can get the request data and do what we want with it in our resolver
    function code.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With Vue 3 apps, we can use specialized GraphQL API clients to make GraphQL
    API request creation easier. All we have to do to make a request is pass in a
    string for the queries and mutations, along with the variables that go with the
    queries and mutations.

    will get an error telling us exactly what is wrong with the request. We also have
