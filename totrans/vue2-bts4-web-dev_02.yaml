    use throughout this book to build our application. We explored a lot about Vue.js;
    we introduced some of the functionalities of Bootstrap, and we checked what we
    can achieve using the Google Firebase console. We know how to start an application
    from scratch using Vue.js. We know how to make it beautiful with the help of Bootstrap,
    and we know how to use Google Firebase to deploy it to live! What does that mean?
    It means that we are 100 percent ready to start developing our application!

    we know what we are going to code, right? In order to know what we will code,
    we have to define the concept of the application, its requirements, and its target
    users. In this book, we will not go through the whole process of design building
    as for this, you have plenty of other books, because it's a big science.

    have given a great amount of talks on how to effectively manage your time so that
    you are efficient and all your KPI values are above any possible benchmarks of
    productivity. Some of these talks are really amazing. When it comes to time-management

    like, which I find very simple to use. It''s called Pomodoro ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique)).
    This technique consists of the following principles:'

    you to configure the amount of time for working Pomodoros and for the short and
    long breaks. Some of them block social network pages during the working Pomodoros;
    some of them produce noises. In the book *Learning Vue.js 2*, we also built a
    simple Pomodoro timer that produced brown noise during the working period and
    showed random kittens during the short breaks.

    a big part of your day sitting or maybe standing because standing desks are quite
    popular nowadays. How often do you change your position during the working day
    (or night)? Do you have problems with your back? Do you go to the gym? Are you
    fond of jogging? How often do you work out at home? Being a developer requires
    a lot of concentration, and it's common for us to forget a bit about ourselves.

    try to solve a time-management problem, but also solve a fitness-management issue.
    Instead of allowing you to do whatever you want during the breaks or displaying
    some random kittens, it will tell you to do a simple workout. The workouts vary
    from very simple head-rotation exercises to push-ups and burpees. The users can
    choose a set of their favorite workouts depending on the kind of office they work
    in. The users can also add new workouts. Workouts can also be rated.

- en: I have a good friend called Safura. She is a working student currently studying
    computer science in Berlin, and we work together in the same team. She is interested
    in the UI/UX topic. Actually, she will write her master's thesis in the **Human-Computer
    Interaction** (**HCI**) area. So, we sat together, and I explained the idea of
    ProFitOro to her. You cannot imagine the number of questions she asked. Then,
    we started to draw. And to redraw. "And what if….?" redraw again.

    of your mockups is the positioning of the elements. You will still work with designers,
    and you will still have to implement this using your favorite programming language
    (which is JavaScript/HTML/CSS for us). Mockups help you remember the important
    details of your application.
