- en: In the previous chapter, we discussed the three main technologies that we will
    use throughout this book to build our application. We explored a lot about Vue.js;
    we introduced some of the functionalities of Bootstrap, and we checked what we
    can achieve using the Google Firebase console. We know how to start an application
    from scratch using Vue.js. We know how to make it beautiful with the help of Bootstrap,
    and we know how to use Google Firebase to deploy it to live! What does that mean?
    It means that we are 100 percent ready to start developing our application!

  zh: 在上一章中，我们讨论了本书中将使用的三种主要技术，以构建我们的应用程序。我们深入探讨了Vue.js的许多内容；我们介绍了Bootstrap的一些功能，并检查了使用Google
    Firebase控制台可以实现什么。我们知道如何使用Vue.js从头开始创建应用程序。我们知道如何在Bootstrap的帮助下使其美观，也知道如何使用Google
    Firebase将其部署到实时环境中！这意味着我们已经百分之百准备好开始开发我们的应用程序了！
- en: Coding an application is a fun, challenging, and exciting process... only if
    we know what we are going to code, right? In order to know what we will code,
    we have to define the concept of the application, its requirements, and its target
    users. In this book, we will not go through the whole process of design building
    as for this, you have plenty of other books, because it's a big science.

    you are efficient and all your KPI values are above any possible benchmarks of
    productivity. Some of these talks are really amazing. When it comes to time-management

- en: There are numerous implementations of the Pomodoro timer. Some of them allow
    you to configure the amount of time for working Pomodoros and for the short and
    long breaks. Some of them block social network pages during the working Pomodoros;
    some of them produce noises. In the book *Learning Vue.js 2*, we also built a
    simple Pomodoro timer that produced brown noise during the working period and
    showed random kittens during the short breaks.

    a big part of your day sitting or maybe standing because standing desks are quite
    popular nowadays. How often do you change your position during the working day
    (or night)? Do you have problems with your back? Do you go to the gym? Are you
    fond of jogging? How often do you work out at home? Being a developer requires
    a lot of concentration, and it's common for us to forget a bit about ourselves.

    try to solve a time-management problem, but also solve a fitness-management issue.
    Instead of allowing you to do whatever you want during the breaks or displaying
    some random kittens, it will tell you to do a simple workout. The workouts vary
    from very simple head-rotation exercises to push-ups and burpees. The users can
    choose a set of their favorite workouts depending on the kind of office they work
    in. The users can also add new workouts. Workouts can also be rated.

    and nouns such as **e-mail,** and **registration** mean that the application will
    probably be used with and without registration. This means that the first page
    would probably contain the *login* and *registration* area, and somehow, it should
    also contain a link to the application that is possible to use without any authentication
    beforehand.

    main actions that are applicable to our Pomodoro timer. We can start the application,
    we can pause it, and of course, we can stop it at any time of our working day.
    By the way, **working day** is one of our retrieved nouns. So, this means that
    the main page of our application will contain the countdown timer that will have
    the possibility of being started, paused, and stopped.

    **exercise**, **workout**, and so on. This is actually what we are trying to achieve
    with this application—to train our *body* while we have a Pomodoro break. So,
    doing an exercise while taking a break from work. Note that there are also verbs
    such as **check** and **finish**. So, the exercise can be *finished* and something
    can be *checked*, indicating that the user has *finished* exercising. That's why,
    this Pomodoro interval representation should contain a *checkbox*. It should also
    contain a link that leads to the next exercise in case you spend less time on
    the current one. It might also have a skip button in case you are totally not
    into the exercise during this interval.

    able to access their *statistical data* about the workouts performed during the
    *day*, *week,* or *month* (check out that there are actually **Day** and **Week**
    nouns in the nouns list). So, there will be another screen that will display the
    user's *statistics*.

    It makes sense—some users might feel that for them, the working time should be

    or 20 minutes. These values should be *configurable*. Thus, we come yet to another
    screen—*configuration*. In this screen, the users will be able to reset their
    passwords and configure their Pomodoro timers for working time, and short and
    long time breaks.'

    We already discussed that workouts that appear during the Pomodoro breaks are
    a result of a collaborative work of the users of the application. So, there should
    be a *section* (check that the word **section** is also present in our list of
    nouns) that allows *visualizing* existing workouts and *creating* new ones.
