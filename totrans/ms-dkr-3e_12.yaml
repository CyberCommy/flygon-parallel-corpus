    Docker Machine to launch a Docker host in the cloud. Like in the previous chapters,
    I will be using my preferred operating system, which is macOS. As previously, the
    Docker commands that we will run will work on all three of the operating systems
    that we have installed Docker on so far. However, some of the supporting commands,
    which will be few and far between, may only apply to macOS and Linux based operating
    systems.

- en: When Docker was first released, there was a lot of talk about Docker versus
    virtual machines. I remember reading articles in magazines, commenting on threads
    on Reddit, and reading endless blog posts. In the early days of the Docker alpha
    and beta versions, people used to approach Docker containers like virtual machines,
    because there weren't really any other points of reference, and we viewed them
    as tiny VMs.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the past, I would enable SSH, run multiple processes in containers, and even
    create my container images by launching a container and running the commands to
    install my software stack. This is something that we discussed in [Chapter 2](55a49886-9299-4a9b-a3b6-241641a6c097.xhtml)*,
    Building Container Images*; you should never do it, as it is considered a bad
    practice.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So, rather than discussing containers versus virtual machines, let's look at
    some of the considerations that you need to make when running containers, rather
    than virtual machines.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The advantages
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When you start a Docker container, the Docker Engine does a lot of work behind
    the scenes. One of the tasks that the Docker Engine performs when launching your
    containers is setting up namespaces and control groups. What does that mean? By
    setting up namespaces, Docker keeps the processes isolated in each container -
    not only from other containers, but also from the host system. The control groups
    ensure that each container gets its own share of items, such as CPU, memory, and
    disk I/O. More importantly, they ensure that one container doesn't exhaust all
    of the resources on a given Docker host.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As you saw in previous chapters, being able to launch your containers into a
    Docker controlled network means that you can isolate your containers at the application
    level; all of the containers for Application A will not have any access, at the
    network layer, to the containers for Application B.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Additionally, this network isolation can run on a single Docker host by using
    the default network driver, or it can span multiple Docker hosts by using Docker
    Swarm's built-in, multi-host networking driver, or the Weave Net driver from Weave.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Lastly, what I consider one of the biggest advantages of Docker over a typical
    virtual machine is that you shouldn't have to log in to the container. Docker
    is trying its hardest to keep you from needing to log in to a container to manage
    the process that it is running. With commands such as `docker container exec`,
    `docker container top`, `docker container logs`, and `docker container stats`,
    you can do everything that you need to do, without exposing any more services
    than you have to.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Your Docker host
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When you are dealing with virtual machines, you can control who has access to
    which virtual machine. Let's suppose that you only want User 1, who is a developer,
    to have access to the development VMs. However, User 2 is an operator who is responsible
    for both the development and production environments, so he needs access to all
    of the VMs. Most virtual machine management tools allow you to grant role-based
    access to your VMs.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With Docker, you have a little disadvantage, because whoever has access to the
    Docker Engine on your Docker host, either through being granted sudo access or
    by having their user added to the Docker Linux group, has access to every Docker
    container that you are running. They can run new containers, they can stop existing
    containers, and they can delete images, as well. Be careful with who you grant
    permission to access the Docker Engine on your hosts. They essentially hold the
    keys to the kingdom, with respect to all of your containers. Knowing this, it
    is recommended to use Docker hosts only for Docker; keep other services separate
    from your Docker hosts.

- en: Image trust

  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you are running virtual machines, you will most likely be setting them up
    yourself, from scratch. It's likely that, due to the size of the download (and
    also the effort in launching it), you will not download a prebuilt machine image
    that some random person on the internet created. Typically, if you were to do
    this, it would be a prebuilt virtual appliance from a trusted software vendor.
  prefs: []

    as you were responsible for building and maintaining it.

- en: We have already touched upon **image trust** in earlier chapters. For example,
    we spoke about not publishing or downloading images that haven't been defined
    using Dockerfiles, and not embedding custom code or secrets (and so on) directly
    into an image that you will be pushing to the Docker Hub.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: While containers have the protection of namespaces, control groups, and network
    isolation, we discussed how a poorly judged image download can introduce security
    concerns and risk into your environment. For example, a perfectly legitimate container
    running an unpatched piece of software can introduce risk to the availability
    of your application and data.

    container run` command, so that you can see some of the items that you can use
    to your advantage with this command. Secondly, we will take a look at the `docker

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With respect to the `docker run` command, we will mainly focus on the option
    that allows you to set everything inside the container as read-only, instead of
    a specified directory or volume. This helps to limit the amount of damage that
    can be caused by malicious applications that could also hijack a vulnerable application
    by updating its binaries.

    to read-only (except for a specified volume), we can do the opposite and set just
    a single volume (or more, if you use more `-v` switches) to read-only. The thing
    to remember about volumes is that when you use a volume and mount it into a container,
    it will mount as an empty volume over the top of the directory inside of the container,
    unless you use the `--volumes-from` switch or add data to the container in some

    a look at some of the things that you must consider when running containers (versus
    typical virtual machines), with regards to security. We looked at the advantages
    and your Docker host, and then we discussed image trust. We then took a look at
    the Docker commands that we can use for security purposes.

- en: We launched a read-only container, so that we can minimize any potential damage
    an intruder can do within our running containers. As not all applications lend
    themselves to running in read-only containers, we then looked at how we can track
    changes that have been made to the image since it was launched. It is always useful
    to be able to easily discover any changes that were made on the filesystem at
    runtime, when trying to look into any problems.

    We then analyzed the output, to see what it meant. Remember the seven items that
