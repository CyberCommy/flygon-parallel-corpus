    of successful intrusions, both local and remote. As a trained network administrator,
    or security engineer, you have counselled users to make their passwords stronger
    many times. What you may not be aware of is that many technology professionals
    make weak passwords or patterns of passwords that endanger not just their own
    accounts, but the entire network that they maintain. This chapter will show you
    several tools for testing the passwords on your network, so you can help guide
    your users to the habit of better passwords.

    going to be cracked in fewer than 20 seconds, while the second password hash for
    `GoodLuckTryingToCrackMyPassword!` may take several months to crack. The following
    list illustrates some of the passwords you will find in any of the dozens of word
    lists that you can find on the internet, and that make cracking passwords so much
    easier. Some common hashes can be cracked by [https://www.google.com](https://www.google.com),
    just by pasting the hash into the search bar. Most web applications and operating
    systems add a few characters, called `salt`, to the user's password choice, so
    as to make a simple cryptographic hash a bit more complicated and less guessable.

- en: Passwords are normally the keys to any system or network. Ever since the dawn
    of computers, passwords have been used to lock system data from unwanted eyes.
    So password cracking is a much-needed skill in the hacking trade. Capture or crack
    the right password and you have the keys to the kingdom, access to anywhere, any
    time. We'll also talk a bit about creating strong passwords as we go along. If
    you are a systems administrator reading this book, you're the person we are talking
    about. It is your password an attacker is going after. Sure, typing a 12- or 14-character
    password every time you log in to something is a pain, but how important is your
    network?

- en: Personally, we wish the word *password* hadn't been used for this function from
    the beginning. It should be called keys. Normal users of systems cry and whine
    about password-protected data. Most relate the word *password* to entry into a
    clubhouse or something. A user will have locks and burglar alarms on all his property
    but will use a four-letter password on his computer. People relate the word *key*
    to locking something important. Actually, if your password is just a *word*, you
    will be pwned in minutes. It's best to use passphrases. Something like *Mary had
    a little lamb*. is a lot better than just a word. We'll see just how important
    this is in this chapter as we think about the passwords you use.

    *Sniffing and Spoofing*. On a Windows network running NetBIOS, capturing NTLM
    hashes is child's play. They're just floating around in the ARP cloud waiting
    to be plucked. As we have shown in the earlier chapters, when you are using Metasploit,
    you don't need to even crack this hash to a password but can just pass the hash
    to another Windows system.

    use the same password on several classes of devices. Let's say you have some Windows
    hashes and you need to get into a router or a Linux machine to which you are not
    sure of the password. There is a good chance that the passwords are the same on
    other systems, so you can crack the hashes that the NTLM protocol leaks. Lots
    of us are guilty of reusing passwords for infrastructure devices, even though
    we know better. It might be safer to use different usernames and passwords for
    routers and other infrastructure devices, and never use the domain administrator
    accounts to log in to any machines, unless it is absolutely necessary.

    is by using a password list. It's even best to sometimes run a list of, say, the
    500 worst passwords against the users on your system to find those lazy *losers*
    who are using bad passwords. A bad password most of the time can be broken in
    seconds compared to hours, days, or weeks when using a strong pass-phrase.

    cards that can crack passwords like we are using in a matter of hours. Some use
    Amazon AWS and set up instances with a lot of processing power, but this costs
    a lot of money. It's also known that some ingenious college students have fired
    up the college supercomputer meant for modeling the solar system and used these
    systems to crack passwords really fast. Even if your neighborhood evil hacker
    has these kinds of systems, the longer password is still better. Systems like
    these are the reason for using passwords or pass-phrases with a length over 14
    characters. Even with pass-phrases over 14 characters, this shows that if you
    have the hash, it is just a matter of time, money, and processing power before
    you have the password.

- en: xHydra is a GUI frontend for the password cracker called Hydra. Hydra can be
    used for both offline and online password cracking. Hydra can be used for many
    types of online attacks, including attacks against MySQL, SMB, MSSQL, and many
    types of HTTP/HTTPS logins, just to name a few.

    a WordPress site. Since the machine is running a WordPress site and a MySQL service,
    it is an easy guess that the database login's username is `wordpress`, the default
    admin account. By default, MySQL doesn't block brute-force attacks, so we know
    we stand a good chance with this attack.

- en: The speed of this test is mainly determined by the resources and set-up of the
    victim server. Our victim server here is a low-rent VM so this is one reason for
    such a slow test. Also, at the first part of this run, we got a warning that MySQL
    doesn't like a lot of parallel connections. The speed will increase against a
    target server running more resources. Another limiting factor is that the target
    server may be so weak that a sustained brute-force attack might knock the machine
    off the network. Even a strong server with large amounts of resources available
    might experience a **denial of service** (**DoS**) condition. When doing brute-force
    attacks, you might want to aim for low and slow rates of attack speed. As an attacker,
    you do not want to alert the administrators to the attack.
