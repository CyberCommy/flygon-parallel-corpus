- en: 'So, you want to program your own games using **Unreal Engine 4** (**UE4**).
    You have a great number of reasons to do so: UE4 is powerful—UE4 provides some
    of the most state-of-the-art, beautiful, and realistic lighting and physics effects
    available, of the kind used by AAA studios.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'UE4 is device-agnostic: code written for UE4 will work on Windows desktop machines,
    Mac desktop machines, all the major game consoles (if you''re an official developer),
    Android devices, and iOS devices (at the time of writing this book—even more devices
    may be supported in the future!). So, you can use UE4 to write the main parts
    of your game once, and after that, deploy to iOS and Android marketplaces without
    a hitch. (Of course, there will be a few hitches: iOS and Android in-app purchases
    and notifications will have to be programmed separately, and there could be other
    differences.)'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book is for anyone who wants to learn game programming. We'll be going
    through and creating a simple game, so you will get a good idea of the whole process.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book is also for anyone who wants to learn C++, particularly C++ 17\. We'll
    be going over the basics of C++ and how to program in it, with an introduction
    to some of the new features in the latest C++ version.

- en: Finally, the book is for anyone who wants to learn UE4\. We'll be using this
    to create our game. We will be primarily focused on the C++ side, but we will
    be looking at some basic blueprint development.

    members and member functions together into a bundle of code called a class or struct.
    We will learn about encapsulation and how it is easier and more efficient to program
    objects such that they maintain their own internal state.'

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this book, we don't assume that you have any programming background, so if
    you're a complete beginner, that's fine! It would help to know your way around
    a computer, however, as well as knowing some basic game concepts. Of course, if
    you want to program games, it's very likely you've played at least a few!
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We'll be running Unreal Engine 4 and Visual Studio 2017 (or Xcode if you're
    on a Mac), so you probably want to make sure you're running on a recent, and fairly
    powerful, computer (and if you want to do VR, make sure your computer is VR-ready).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Also, be ready to work! UE4 uses C++, which you can learn the basics of pretty
    quickly (and will here), but it can take a long time to really master the language.
    If you're looking for a quick and easy way to create a game, there are other tools
    out there, but if you really want to learn skills that could lead to a career
    programming games, this is a good place to start!
