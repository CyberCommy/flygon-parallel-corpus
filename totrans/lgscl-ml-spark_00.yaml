- en: Machine learning, at its core, is concerned with algorithms that transform raw
    data into information into actionable intelligence. This fact makes machine learning
    well suited to the predictive analytics of Big Data. Without machine learning,
    therefore, it would be nearly impossible to keep up with these massive streams
    of information altogether. Spark, which is relatively a new and emerging technology,
    provides big data engineers and data scientists a powerful response and a unified
    engine that is both faster and easy to use.

    interactively and at much greater scale. The book is designed to enable data scientists,
    engineers, and researchers to develop and deploy their machine learning applications
    at scale so that they can learn how to handle large data clusters in data intensive
    environments to build powerful machine learning models.

    and ML basics, exploring data with feature engineering, building scalable ML pipelines,
    tuning and adapting them through for the new data and problem types, and finally,
    model building to deployment. To clarify more, we have provided the chapters outline
    in such a way that a new reader with a minimum of knowledge of machine learning
    and programming with Spark will be able to follow the examples and move towards
    some real-life machine learning problems and their solutions.

    "Chapter 1. Introduction to Data Analytics with Spark"),* Introduction to Data
    Analytics with Spark*, this chapter covers Spark''s overview, its computing paradigm,
    installation, and help us get started with Spark. It will briefly describe the
    main components of Spark and focus on its new computing advancements with the
    Resilient Distributed Datasets (RDD) and Dataset. It will then focus on the Spark’s
    ecosystem of machine learning libraries. Installing, configuring, and packaging
    a simple machine learning application with Spark and Maven will be demonstrated
    before scaling up on Amazon EC2.'

    provides a conceptual introduction to statistical machine learning (ML) techniques
    aiming to take a newcomer from a minimal knowledge of machine learning all the
    way to being a knowledgeable practitioner in a few steps. The second part of the
    chapter is focused on providing some recommendations for choosing the right machine
    learning algorithms depending on its application types and requirements. It will
    then go through some best practices when applying large-scale machine learning

    the Problem by Understanding the Data*, covers in detail the Dataset and Resilient
    Distributed Dataset (RDD) APIs for working with structured data, aiming to provide
    a basic understanding of machine learning problems with the available data. By
    the end, you will be able to deal with basic and complex data manipulation with
    ease. Some comparisons will be made available with basic abstractions in Spark
    using RDD and Dataset-based data manipulation to show gains both in terms of programming
    and performance. In addition, we will guide you on the right track so that you
    will be able to use Spark to persist an RDD or data object in memory, allowing
    it to be reused efficiently across the parallel operations in the later stage.'

    through Feature Engineering*, explains that knowing the features that should be
    used to create a predictive model is not only vital but also a difficult question
    that may require deep knowledge of the problem domain to be examined. It is possible
    to automatically select those features in data that are most useful or most relevant
    for the problem someone is working on. Considering these questions, this chapter
    covers feature engineering in detail, explaining the reasons to apply it along
    with some best practices in feature engineering.'

    Machine Learning Pipelines*, explains that the ultimate goal of machine learning
    is to make a machine that can automatically build models from data without requiring
    tedious and time-consuming human involvement and interaction. Therefore, this
    chapter guides the readers through creating some practical and widely used machine
    learning pipelines and applications using Spark MLlib and Spark ML. Both APIs
    will be described in detail, and a baseline use case will also be covered for

    shows that tuning an algorithm or machine learning application can be simply thought
    of as a process by which one goes through and optimizes the parameters that impact
    the model in order to enable the algorithm to perform to its best. This chapter
    aims at guiding the reader through model tuning. It will cover the main techniques
    used to optimize an ML algorithm’s performance. Techniques will be explained both
    from the MLlib and Spark ML perspective. We will also show how to improve the
    performance of the ML models by tuning several parameters, such as hyperparameters,
    grid search parameters with MLlib and Spark ML, hypothesis testing, Random search
    parameter tuning, and Cross-validation.'

    data processing and scalability with at least 8 GB RAM (recommended) for a standalone
    mode and at least 32 GB RAM for a single VM, or higher for a cluster. Besides,
    enough storage to run heavy jobs (depending upon the data size you will be handling),

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Python and R are two popular languages for data scientists due to the large
    number of modules or packages that are readily available to help them solve their
    data analytics problems. However, traditional uses of these tools are often limiting,
    as they process data on either a single machine or with main memory-based approaches
    where the movement of data becomes time-consuming, the analysis requires sampling,
    and moving from development to production environments requires extensive re-engineering. To
    address these issues, Spark provides data engineers and data scientists a powerful
    and unified engine that is both faster and easy to use. This allows you to solve
    their machine learning problems interactively and at much greater scale.

    a big data engineer working with large and complex data sets. Furthermore, if
    you want to board your data processing pipelines and machine learning applications
    to scale up more quickly, this book would be a suitable companion to this journey.
    Moreover, Spark provides many language choices, including Scala, Java, and Python.
    This facility will definitely help you to lift your machine learning applications
    on top of Spark and reshape using any one of these programming languages with
