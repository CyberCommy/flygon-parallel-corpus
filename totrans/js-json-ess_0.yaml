- en: '*JavaScript and JSON Essentials* is a one-stop resource that can be used for
    understanding and implementing JSON in various web applications. This book provides
    a comprehensive insight into how JSON can be implemented and integrated into your
    applications. Though JSON is one of the most popular data-exchange formats, the
    number of books available describing JSON and helping readers build a live solution
    is not high. This book is a comprehensive guide to JSON that begins with JavaScript
    basics, discusses the history of JSON, and then takes a step-by-step approach
    towards using JSON to build a live web application that is powered by JSON data.'

- en: JSON is language-and platform-independent, so readers can use an operating system
    of their choice. To serve live JSON, we need a live web server. There are parsers
    available for most of the popular server-side languages; readers can use a web
    server such as Apache, Tomcat, IIS, or any other web server and can pick a text
    editor of their choice.
