- en: '*JavaScript and JSON Essentials* is a one-stop resource that can be used for
    understanding and implementing JSON in various web applications. This book provides
    a comprehensive insight into how JSON can be implemented and integrated into your
    applications. Though JSON is one of the most popular data-exchange formats, the
    number of books available describing JSON and helping readers build a live solution
    is not high. This book is a comprehensive guide to JSON that begins with JavaScript
    basics, discusses the history of JSON, and then takes a step-by-step approach
    towards using JSON to build a live web application that is powered by JSON data.'

    the number of objects increases, the length of JSON increases too, which makes
    it difficult for the naked eye to validate JSON.'

- en: JSON is language-and platform-independent, so readers can use an operating system
    of their choice. To serve live JSON, we need a live web server. There are parsers
    available for most of the popular server-side languages; readers can use a web
    server such as Apache, Tomcat, IIS, or any other web server and can pick a text
    editor of their choice.
