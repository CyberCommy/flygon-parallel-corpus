    You wish to build your own video game, which can be run both in people''s browsers
    as well as on their smartphones and tablets. All of this is possible today, though
    it has not been for the longest time. The reason you can now build your own game
    with relative ease is two fold: **HTML5** and **ImpactJS**.'

- en: '**HTML5** is the latest version of our World Wide Web Hyper Text Markup Language
    and is the universal language for web pages. HTML has been around since the beginning
    of the 1990s when a CERN (the European organization for nuclear research) employee
    by the name of Tim Berners-Lee first introduced it. New versions were released
    quite rapidly: Version 2 in 1995, Version 3 in 1997, and Version 4 later that
    year. We had been using roughly the same version of HTML for over a decade until
    finally HTML5 saw the light in 2008\. With the growing need for multimedia implementation,
    companies had been building browser plugins to play music, show movies, and so
    on. The Flash player is probably one of the best known plugins on this front.
    As a game developer you can still opt for using Flash and ActionScript, but we
    don''t know how long Flash still has until (if ever) it will be fully replaced
    by HTML5\. What will happen to Flash games remains hard to predict but one thing
    is pretty certain: the future of HTML5 based games looks bright. Since HTML5 emerged,
    browsers have been slowly increasing compatibility for it. HTML5 is a huge step
    forward as it introduces new elements to allow playing music and videos on the
    web pages themselves.'

- en: However, the most important new feature for us is the introduction of the `<canvas>`
    element. The `<canvas>` element is basically a placeholder for your graphical
    elements to appear on. Together with the use of JavaScript, it became possible
    to build browser games outside of Flash players. However, JavaScript in itself
    is not geared towards building games. In its raw form, you would be able to use
    it to build a game but it would prove dauntingly difficult. Thus, the last necessary
    ingredient is a JavaScript library with the sole purpose of game development.
    This is where ImpactJS comes into play.

    life as a game developer a lot easier. ImpactJS was developed by Dominic Szablewski,
    a German genius, to say the least. The ImpactJS game engine has the advantage
    of enabling you to build a game very quickly with only a basic knowledge of JavaScript
    and HTML. This allows even a newbie programmer to focus on what they love: building
    the actual game. ImpactJS also comes with a very intuitive level editor and debug
    system, which we will also get into during the course of this book. ImpactJS is
    designed to build tile-based two-dimensional games. For instance, if you like
    to build a side-scrolling game such as **Mario** or a top-down game such as **Zelda**,
    you will want to go with ImpactJS. Now without much further ado, let''s dive into
    the action by moving on to [Chapter 1](ch01.html "Chapter 1. Firing Up Your First
    Impact Game"), *Firing Up Your First Impact Game*, where we will prepare ourselves
    for game development by gathering the necessary resources for it.'
