    things melting faster than the polar ice caps are assets under active management.
    Evolution does not take prisoners. If active managers do not want to go join the
    bluefin tuna on the list of endangered species, then maybe learning to sell short
    would be an invaluable skill to add to their arsenal. As the global financial
    crisis of 2007-2008 showed us, it's crucial for market participants to be capable
    of generating profits not only in bull but also in bear markets. To that end,
    this book will cover the ins and outs of short selling, and develop algorithmic
    strategies to maximize its effectiveness, with the end goal of creating a robust
    investment product that will set you apart from your market competitors.

    out the trade two weeks later, while the gambler forgets about it and doubles
    his money over the next 3 years. For the trader, poker is a hobby, and he won
    the poker night because he knew he could afford more risk. Meanwhile, the poker
    player took calculated risks. He accepted the short-term loss as part of winning
    the long-term game. When the poker player followed the investment tip, he rode
    it through the ups and downs, as he was merely using a disposable asset. On the
    other hand, when the trader closed the same stock and missed the ensuing rally,
    he was executing risk management.
