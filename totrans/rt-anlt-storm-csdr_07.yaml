- en: Consistent hashing works on the concept in its name—that is *hashing* and as
    we know, for a said hashing algorithm, the same key will always return the same
    hash code—thus, making the approach pretty deterministic by nature and implementation.
    When we use this approach for sharding or dividing the keys across the nodes in
    the cluster, consistent hashing is the technique that determines which node is
    stored in which node in the cluster.

    follows the AP principal of the CAP theorem. Consistency refers to how up to date
    the information across all data replicas in a Cassandra cluster is. Cassandra
    does eventually guarantee consistency. Now let's have a closer look; well, let's
    say I have five node Cassandra clusters and a replication factor of 3\. This means
    if I have a *data item1*, it would be replicated to three nodes, let's say node1,
    node2, and node3; let's assume the key of this datum is *key1*. Now if the value
    of this key is to be rewritten and the write operation is performed on node1,
    then Cassandra internally replicates the values to other replicas, which are node2
    and node3\. But this update happens in the background and is not immediate; this
    is the mechanism of eventual consistency.

    As soon as the acknowledgement count reaches the value mentioned on consistency
    of the operation, the thread is completed and the client is notified about its
    success. On the remaining replicas, the values are written using hinted handoffs.
    The hinted handoff approach is a savior when a few nodes are down. Let''s say
    one of the replicas is down and a write operation is executed with a consistency
    of `ANY`; in that case, one replica takes the write operation and hints to the
    neighboring replicas, which are currently down. When the downed replicas are revived,
    then the values are written back to them by taking hints from live replicas.'

  zh: 摘要
- en: In this chapter, you have understood the concepts of replication and data partitioning
    in Cassandra. We also understood the replication strategy and the concept of eventual
    consistency. The exercise at the end of the chapter is a good hands-on exercise
    to help you understand the concepts covered in the chapter in a practical way.
