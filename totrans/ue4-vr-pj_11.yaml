- en: One of the major factors that differentiates professional developers from the
    newbies is how they leverage existing tools and libraries to accelerate their
    work. Very often, new developers try to do everything themselves, either because
    they're unaware of resources that could help them or because they think that leaning
    on an existing library is somehow *cheating*. It isn't. If you're a photographer,
    you're not cheating if you didn't build your own camera in your garage—you're
    focusing on the part of your art that actually matters to you. Don't be afraid
    to make use of tools and libraries that can accelerate your development.

  zh: 区分专业开发者和新手开发者的一个重要因素是他们如何利用现有的工具和库来加速工作。很多时候，新手开发者尝试自己做所有的事情，要么是因为他们不知道有哪些资源可以帮助他们，要么是因为他们认为依赖现有的库是一种“作弊”。其实不是这样的。如果你是一名摄影师，在你的车库里没有自己建造相机并不是作弊——你只是专注于你真正关心的艺术部分。不要害怕利用可以加速你开发的工具和库。
- en: 'Here''s the rub though: to make effective use of another developer''s work,
    you need to put in the effort to understand what they''re doing. Don''t simply
    paste in someone else''s code without really understanding why it works—you''re
    just asking for difficult-to-find bugs if you do this. Do your homework and find
    code you can rely on, but consider it part of your homework to understand how
    it''s built so you can make deliberate choices about how you use it.'

  zh: 然而，要有效地利用其他开发者的工作，你需要付出努力去理解他们在做什么。不要只是简单地粘贴别人的代码而不真正理解它为什么有效——如果你这样做，你只会引发难以找到的错误。做好功课，找到你可以依赖的代码，但同时也要把它作为你的功课的一部分，去理解它是如何构建的，这样你才能在使用它时做出明智的选择。
- en: Sooner or later in your development career, you'll encounter the phrase *cargo
    cult programming*. This term, commonly attributed to the physicist Richard Feynman,
    refers to aboriginal religious practices observed in some islands of the South
    Pacific after World War II, whereby the natives built replica airfields in an
    attempt to lure back the god-like cargo planes that had supplied the islands during
    the war. In doing this, they were reproducing the forms, but they didn't understand
    how those forms worked and didn't understand why they weren't working now. Don't
    let this describe how you develop software. For anything you include in the project
    you're building, you should be able to give a clear answer when another engineer
    points to any part of it and asks, *What is this doing*? This won't be possible
    in all cases, of course, but in general, consider that your work isn't finished
    until you've spent the time to understand how the library or plugin is doing what
    it's doing.

  zh: 在你的开发生涯中，迟早会遇到“模仿神秘”的编程术语。这个术语通常被归功于物理学家理查德·费曼，它指的是二战后南太平洋一些岛屿上观察到的土著宗教习俗，他们建造了复制的机场，试图吸引战争期间供应岛屿的神秘货机回来。他们只是复制了形式，但他们不理解这些形式是如何工作的，也不理解为什么它们现在不起作用。不要让这描述你开发软件的方式。对于你在项目中包含的任何内容，当另一个工程师指着其中的任何部分问“这是做什么的？”时，你应该能够给出一个清晰的答案。当然，并非所有情况下都可能做到这一点，但总的来说，要考虑到你的工作在你花时间去理解库或插件是如何工作的之前是不完整的。

    It's licensed under the MIT license (we're going to talk about licenses shortly—they're
    important), which means that it can be used freely in both non-commercial and
    commercial software. It doesn't cost anything, but it represents absolutely outstanding

    develop strategies to learn how unfamiliar code works so you can leverage it for
    your own development and use it to learn advanced techniques. This is one of the
    most important skills you can cultivate as a developer. It's fairly easy to find
    tutorials for basic topics, but once you get into more advanced territory, you
    mostly need to learn by looking at other advanced work. It's not as daunting as
    it might seem at first. We're going to learn a number of strategies to do this

    version for which you're trying to compile it.)

  zh: 如果一个插件包含这个条目，虚幻将只允许它与指定的引擎版本一起加载。（你可以通过手动修改`.uplugin`文件中的这个值来绕过这个限制，但插件是否能编译和工作将完全取决于其中的内容以及你尝试编译的引擎版本中发生了什么变化。）

    recommends that you use their code. There are benefits and drawbacks to each approach.
    The first approach tends to get you working much earlier, but you'll often wind
    up with a lot of extra stuff that you don't need that then needs to be cleaned
    out. (Remember that we don't believe in cargo-cult programming here—you're not
    simply going to dump this code into your project and walk away without understanding
    it.) The second approach can take a more time, but gives you a clean class that

    you''re experimenting with the class as the author wrote it, and learning how
    it works and how it''s meant to be used. Then, once you have a handle on things,
    start pulling out the stuff you now know you don''t need, and changing things
    that need to work differently, until you have a version that does what you need
    it to do. Now, move into your *make it right* phase. Is it OK as it is? Could
    it be maintained easily? Would another engineer, or future-you, a year from now,
    be able to read this blueprint and understand what''s going on? Consider in light

    this is taking place in a function called `Cycle Movement Modes`. We could then
    use the strategies we've learned to see when and how this function gets called,
    and what else happens along with it.

    discourage yourself if you try to make sense of it all at once. Instead, you find
    a single strand and start following it and pulling it apart, and the structure
    of it becomes clear as you go. These tools can help you to do this.

- en: This chapter took a bit of a different turn from the tutorials we've done up
    to this point, as its intention really is to help you to get to a point where
    you can explore the numerous plugins, templates, examples, and other projects
    you find within the Unreal ecosystem and learn how to use them to accelerate your
    work and learn new techniques. This is one of the most valuable skills you can
    teach yourself as a developer. If you get comfortable exploring code you find
    in the wild, you'll develop much more powerful software in a much shorter time
    and learn more advanced techniques by seeing how experienced developers have approached
    the problem you're trying to solve. This will make you a better developer faster.
