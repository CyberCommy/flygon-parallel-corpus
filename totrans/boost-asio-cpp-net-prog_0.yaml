- en: Network applications were not very easy to develop about two decades ago. But
    thanks to Boost.Asio, which has provided us with the network programming function
    as well as the asynchronous operations functionality to program a network application,
    we can now develop them easily. Since data transmission over a network can take
    a long time, which means acknowledgments and errors may not be available as fast
    as the functions that send or receive data can execute, the asynchronous operations
    functionality is really required in network application programming. In this book,
    you will learn the basics of networking and also how to develop a network application
    using the Boost.Asio libraries.

    Programming in C++"), *Simplifying Your Network Programming in C++*, explains
    the preparation of a C++ compiler, which will be used to compile all the source
    code in this book. Also, it will tell us how to compile a single source code and
    link to multiple source codes.'

    Concepts"), *Understanding the Networking Concepts*, covers the network reference
    models, which are OSI and TCP/IP. It also provides various TCP/IP tools that we
    will often be using to detect whether an error has occurred in our network connection.'

    an I/O service''s work in order to ensure that the order of work completely matches
    the order we have designed. It also covers how to handle errors and exceptions
    and create time delays in network programming.'
