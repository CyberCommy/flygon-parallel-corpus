- en: 'A lot has changed in the React ecosystem since the first edition of React Essentials.
    More people are building React applications, there are mature libraries and frameworks
    that support React applications, and React 16 has been released. The explosive
    growth of React over such a short period of time can be attributed to a number
    of factors: the excellent community and related resources, the vastness of the
    React ecosystem and the maturation of certain staple projects, and of course,
    the React team and their willingness to make developer feedback a priority item
    as the project continues to evolve.'

    maintainable user interfaces for the web. Some core knowledge of JavaScript, HTML,
    and CSS is the only thing you need to know to start benefiting from the revolutionary
    ideas that React.js brings into the web development world. If you have previous
    experience with jQuery or Angular.js, then you will benefit from understanding
    how React.js is different and how to take advantage of integrating different libraries
    with it.
