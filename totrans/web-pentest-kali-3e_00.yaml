- en: Web applications, and more recently, web services are now a part of our daily
    life—from government procedures to social media to banking applications; they
    are even on mobile applications that send and receive information through the
    use of web services. Companies and people in general use web applications excessively
    daily. This fact alone makes web applications an attractive target for information
    thieves and other criminals. Hence, protecting these applications and their infrastructure
    from attacks is of prime importance for developers and owners.

    abuse of the functionalities of applications for generating misinformation, or
    collection of user's information, which is then sold to advertising companies.
    People are starting to be more concerned of how their information is used and
    protected by the companies the trust with it. So, companies need to take proactive
    actions to prevent such leaks or attacks from happening. This is done in many
    fronts, from stricter quality controls during the development process to PR and
    managing the media presence when an incident is detected.

    increasing the complexity in the multitude of technologies is required to create
    a modern web application. Also, some inherited bad practices developers are not
    able to fully test their web application from a security perspective, given that
    their priority is to deliver a working product on time. This complexity in web
    applications and in the development process itself creates the need for a professional
    specialized in security testing, who gets involved in the process and takes responsibility
    of putting the application to test from a security perspective, more specifically,
    from an attacker's point of view. This professional is a penetration tester.

    testing, to cover every phase in the methodology; from gaining information to
    identifying possible weak spots to exploiting vulnerabilities. A key task of a
    penetration tester is this: once they find and verify a vulnerability, they need
    to advise the developers on how to fix such flaws and prevent them from recurring.
    Therefore, all the chapters in this book that are dedicated to identification
    and exploitation of vulnerabilities also include a section briefly covering how
    to prevent and mitigate each of such attacks.'

- en: We made this book keeping several kinds of readers in mind. First, computer
    science students, developers, and systems administrators who want to go one step
    further in their knowledge regarding information security or those who want to
    pursue a career in this field; these will find some basic concepts and easy to
    follow instructions, which will allow them to perform their first penetration
    test in their own testing laboratory, and also get the basis and tools to continue
    practicing and learning.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    behave in the real world, what aspects should be taken into account to build more
    secure applications and systems, and how to detect malicious behavior.

- en: Finally, seasoned security professionals will find some intermediate and advanced
    exploitation techniques and ideas on how to combine two or more vulnerabilities
    in order to perform a more sophisticated attack.

    to Penetration Testing and Web Applications*, covers the basic concepts of penetration
    testing, Kali Linux, and web applications. It starts with the definition of penetration
    testing itself and other key concepts, followed by the considerations to have
    before engaging in a professional penetration test such as defining scope and
    rules of engagement. Then we dig into Kali Linux and see how web applications
    work, focusing on the aspects that are more relevant to a penetration tester.'

    Up Your Lab with Kali Linux*, is a technical review of the testing environment
    that will be used through the rest of the chapters. We start by explaining what
    Kali Linux is and the tools it includes for the purpose of testing security of
    web applications; next we look at the vulnerable web applications that will be
    used in future chapters to demonstrate the vulnerabilities and attacks.'

    and Profiling the Web Server*, shows the techniques and tools used by penetration
    testers and attackers to gain information about the technologies used to develop,
    host and support the target application and identify the first weak spots that
    may be further exploited, because, following the standard methodology for penetration
    testing, the first step is to gather as much information as possible about the
    targets.'

    exploitation, and mitigation of vulnerabilities related to the identification
    of users and segregation of duties within the application, starting with the explanation
    of different authentication and session management mechanisms, followed by how
    these mechanisms can have design or implementation flaws and how those flaws can
    be taken advantage of by a malicious actor or a penetration tester.'

    of the most common injection flaws, because one of the top concerns of developers
    in terms of security is having their applications vulnerable to any kind of injection
    attack, be it SQL injection, command injection, or any other attack, these can
    pose a major risk on a web application.'

    what is a Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability, to how and why it poses a security

    can take advantage of it to grab sensitive information from the user or make them

    concepts that are useful from the perspective of penetration testers, such as
    how SSL/TLS works in general, a review of concepts and algorithms of encryption,
    and encoding and hashing; then we describe the tools used to identify weak SSL/TLS
    implementations, together with the exploitation of well-known vulnerabilities.

    algorithms and implementations. We finish the chapter with an advice on how to
