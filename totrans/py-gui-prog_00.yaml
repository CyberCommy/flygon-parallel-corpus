- en: A responsive graphical user interface (GUI) helps you interact with your application, improves
    user experience, and enhances the efficiency of your applications. With Python,
    you’ll have access to elaborate GUI frameworks that you can use to build interactive
    GUIs that stand apart from the rest.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This Learning Path begins by introducing you to Tkinter and PyQt, before guiding you
    through the application development process. As you expand your GUI by adding
    more widgets, you'll work with networks, databases, and graphical libraries that
    enhance its functionality. You'll also learn how to connect to external databases and
    network resources, test your code, and maximize performance using asynchronous
    programming. In later chapters, you'll understand how to use the cross-platform
    features of Tkinter and Qt5 to maintain compatibility across platforms. You’ll
    be able to mimic the platform-native look and feel, and build executables for
    deployment across popular computing platforms.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: By the end of this Learning Path, you'll have the skills and confidence to design
    and build high-end GUI applications that can solve real-world problems.

- en: This book expects that you know the basics of Python 3\. You should know how
    to write and run simple scripts using built-in types and functions, how to define
    your own functions and classes, and how to import modules from the standard library.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You can follow this book if you run Windows, macOS, Linux, or even BSD. Ensure
    that you have Python 3 and Tcl/Tk installed and that you have an editing environment
    with which you are comfortable (we suggest IDLE since it comes with Python and
    uses Tkinter). In the later chapters, you'll need access to the internet so that
    you can install Python packages and the PostgreSQL database.

    Android device. To package Python scripts into Android’s APK using the Kivy library,
    you need to install Kivy, a Virtual Box, and Buildozer packager. Similarly, to
    run Python scripts on iOS devices, you need a macOS machine and some library tools,
    including Cython.
