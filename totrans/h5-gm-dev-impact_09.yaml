    making money with HTML5 game development. Building games can be done purely as

    few things into consideration before starting off building one. The first question
    you will need to ask yourself is probably this: who am I going to build a game
    for? Are you aiming at everyone capable of playing games or do you want to target
    a very specific segment of people and meet their gaming needs? This is the difference
    between broad and niche targeting. An example of very broadly targeted games are
    most tower defense games, in which you need to build towers with diverse properties
    to repel an army. Games such as Tetris, Bejeweled , Minesweeper , and most light
    puzzle games in general. Angry Birds is another example of a game that is popular
    with a broad audience because of its simplicity, likeable graphics, and incredible
    amount of clever marketing.'

    Even if you do well from the start, you can still become better at it. A game
    at which you cannot become better by replaying doesn't hold up for long. Notable

    be addictive; but that is for other reasons, such as the chance to win money.

    a potential user of your game. As such, the achievable success can be enormous.
    World of Warcraft is a game which has moved from rather hardcore and niche to
    more casual over the years. They did this because they had already reached most
    regular gamers out there, and decided to convince the masses that you can play
    World of Warcraft even if you don't play a lot in general. The downside of trying
    to please everyone is the amount of competition. Sticking out as a unique game
    among numerous games out there is tremendously difficult. This is especially true
    if you don't have an impressive marketing machine to back it up.

    targeted solely at a specific group of gamers. For example, people who prefer

    mediocre games. Every game you release should have an original touch to it—something

    prefer it over all the others?
  prefs: []

- en: Then, of course, there is the sniper strategy, which involves building a decent
    and well-thought-out game and releasing it to the market with the utmost care
    and support. This is what distributors such as Apple urge developers to do, and
    for good reason—you wouldn't want your app store full of crappy games, would you?
    Some other game distributers, such as Steam, are even pickier in the games they
    allow to be distributed, making the shotgun strategy nearly impossible. But it
    is also the strategy most successful game developers use. Take a look at developers
    such as Rockstar (developer of the GTA series), Besthesda (developer of the Elder
    Scroll series), Bioware (developer of the Mass Effect series), Blizzard (developer
    of the Warcraft series), and many others. These are no small fries, yet they don't
    have that many games on the market. This tactic of developing high quality games
    and hoping they will pay off is obviously not without risk. In order to develop
    a truly amazing game, you also need the time and money to do so. If your game
    fails to sell, this can be a real problem for you or your company. Even for HTML5
    games, this can be the case, especially since devices and browsers keep getting
    more and more powerful. When the machines running the games get more powerful,
    the games themselves often become more complex and take longer to develop.

    Store, Amazon Appstore, SlideMe, Mobango, Getjar, and Apple Appsfire. But the
    most popular players on the market currently are **Google Play** and the **iOS
    App Store** . The iOS App Store is not to be confused with the Mac app store.
    iPad and Mac have two different operating systems, iOS and Mac OS, so they have
    separate stores. Games can be released both in the iOS and the Mac store. There
    could also be some confusion between Google Play and **Chrome Web Store** . Google
    Play contains all the apps available for smartphones that have Google's Android
    operating system. The Chrome Web Store lets you add apps to your Google Chrome
    browser. So there are quite a few distribution channels to pick from and here
    we will have a quick look at Google Play, the iOS App store, and the Chrome Web

    make use of their virtual shelves and have all its benefits. You can set your
    price as you please, but for every game you sell, Google will cash in about 30
    percent. It is possible to do some geological price discrimination. So you could
    set your price at, let's say €1 in Belgium, while charging €2 in Germany. You
    can change your price at any time; however, if you release a game for free, there
    is no turning back. The only way to monetize this app afterwards is by allowing
    in game advertising, selling add-ons, or creating an in-game currency that can
    be bought with real money.
  prefs: []

    appealing format. A really successful example of this monetizing scheme can be
    found in The Smurfs games. In this game you build your own Smurf village, complete
    with Big Smurf, Smurfette, and a whole lot of mushrooms. Your city gets bigger
    as you plant more crops and build new houses, but it is a slow process. To speed
    it up a bit you can buy special berries in exchange for real money, which in turn
    allows you to build exclusive mushrooms and other things. This monetization scheme
    becomes very popular as has been shown in games such as League Of Legends, PlanetSide
    2, World of Tanks, and many others. For Google Play apps, this in-app payment
    system is supported by Android's Google Checkout.

    a difference. The entire game is free, but players can opt to pay real money to
    buy things that would otherwise cost them a lot of time to acquire. In this freemium

    are focused on Flash games and require many unique visitors before even allowing
    you to show their ads. Tictacti is a notable exception, as it has low prerequisites
    and an easy implementation; though advertising is currently limited to pre-roll
    ads.

- en: The last option we will investigate in this chapter is selling your game's distribution
    rights. You can still make money by just posting your game to all the app stores
    and on your own website, but it becomes increasingly difficult to be noticed.
    Quality can only prevail if people know it is out there, thus making a good game
    is sometimes not enough—you need marketing. If you are a beginner game builder
    with great game ideas and the skills to back it up, that's great, but marketing
    may not be your cup of tea. This is where MarketJS comes into play.

    your game development strategy. Do you wish to adapt a shotgun approach and develop
    a lot of games in a short time span? Or will you use the sniper strategy and only
    build a few, but very polished games? You also need to decide upon the audience
    you wish to reach out to with your game. You have the option of building a game
    that is liked by everyone, but the competition is steep.

    are allowed to freely play your game but they pay real money for extras. This
    is an easily tolerated model since the game is essentially free to play for anyone
    not willing to spend money, and no annoying advertising is present either.

    final push for you to start creating your own games and maybe even make a living
    out of it. Sometimes, developing a game can be frustrating, as the devil is often
    in the detail. You might find yourself cursing your screen more often than you
    like, but remember that it''s not the computer''s fault, and with enough determination
    you will always find a solution. If you find yourself lost at times, the ImpactJS
    website has a great forum full of very helpful people and I would greatly encourage
    you to make use of it and share your thoughts, questions, and ideas there. When
    you close this book and start building your game, don''t forget that having a
    plan and working in a very structured way will be the key elements to success
    and might prevent many sleepless nights. Making changes and improvements in a
    step-by-step manner and always checking if everything still works as intended
    is the way to go and deliver a perfectly functioning game. But regardless of all
    the benefits that can be reaped from organized and structured thinking, there
    lies another most important thing: your imagination.'
