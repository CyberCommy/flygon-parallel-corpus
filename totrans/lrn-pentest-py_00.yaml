- en: Welcome to *Learning Penetration Testing with Python*. This book takes a radically
    different approach to teaching both penetration testing and scripting with Python,
    instead of highlighting how to create scripts that do the same thing as the current
    tools in the market, or highlighting specific types of exploits that can be written.
    We will explore how to approach an engagement, and see where scripting fits into
    an assessment and where the current tools meet the needs. This methodology will
    teach you not only how to go from building introductory scripts to multithreaded
    attack tools, but also how to assess an organization like a professional regardless
    of your experience level.

    *Understanding the Penetration Testing Methodology*, highlights the specific tactics,
    techniques, and procedures that assessors use to evaluate the resistance of an
    organization''s security strategy. It also covers Simulated malicious actors and
    the common tools of the trade.'

    Python"), *Identifying Targets with Nmap, Scapy, and Python*, builds the foundational
    network packet and protocol knowledge, which then translates directly into writing
    Python scripts that utilize the Nmap and Scapy libraries to automate target identification
    for exploitation.'

    Services with Python*, features how exploits are identified to gain initial access,
    how post-exploitation techniques are researched to gain privileged access, and
    how that access is leveraged to gain access to other systems using automated scripts.'

    *Assessing Web Applications with Python*, is a climax of techniques that pivot
    on the automation of analyzing a web application''s weaknesses. This is where
    Python can be used to improve assessments of complex applications with chained
    techniques.'

    the Perimeter with Python*, emphasizes some of the common techniques that real
    malicious actors and assessors alike use to gain access to the semi-trusted and
    trusted networks of an organization. This is done using tools and techniques that
    include Python and hinge on current industry practices.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The most important things you need are the will to learn and the drive to improve
    your capabilities. Supporting these, you will need a system that can support multiple
    Virtual Machines (VMs) that run within an industry-standard hypervisor, such as
    VMware Workstation (a recent version) or Virtual Box. The preferred solution is
    VMware Workstation running on a recent version of Windows, such as Windows 7\.
    An Internet connection will be required to allow you to download the supporting
    libraries and software packages, as necessary. Each of the detailed software packages
    and libraries will be listed at the beginning of each chapter.
